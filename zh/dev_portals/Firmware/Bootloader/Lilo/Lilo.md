# Lilo



LILO is a versatile boot loader for Linux. It does not depend on a
specific file system, can boot Linux kernel images from floppy disks and
hard disks, and can even boot other operating systems. One of up to
sixteen different images can be selected at boot time. Various
parameters, such as the root device, can be set independently for each
kernel. LILO can even be used as the master boot record.
