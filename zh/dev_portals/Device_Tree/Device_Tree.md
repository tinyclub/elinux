## Introduction

Device Tree data can be represented in several different formats. It is
derived from the device tree format used by Open Firmware to encapsulate
platform information and convey it to the Linux operating system. The
device tree data is typically created and maintained in a human readable
format in .dts source files and .dtsi source include files. The Linux
build system pre-processes the source with cpp.

The device tree source is compiled into a binary format contained in a
.dtb blob file. The format of the data in the .dtb blob file is commonly
referred to as a Flattened Device Tree (FDT). The Linux operating system
uses the device tree data to find and register the devices in the
system. The FDT is accessed in the raw form during the very early phases
of boot, but is expanded into a kernel internal data structure for more
efficient access for later phases of the boot and after the system has
completed booting.

Currently the Linux kernel can read device tree information in the ARM,
x86, Microblaze, PowerPC, and Sparc architectures. There is interest in
extending support for device trees to other platforms, to unify the
handling of platform description across kernel architectures.

### The Flattened Device Tree is...

The Flattened Device Tree (FDT) is a data structure. Nothing more.

It describes a machine hardware configuration. It is derived from the
device tree format used by Open Firmware. The format is expressive and
able to describe most board design aspects including:

-   the number and type of CPUs,
-   base addresses and size of RAM,
-   busses and bridges,
-   peripheral device connections, and
-   interrupt controllers and IRQ line connections.

Just like initrd images, an FDT image can either be statically linked
into the kernel or passed to the kernel at boot time.

### The Flattened Device Tree is not...

-   is not a solution to all board port problems
    -   Nothing will eliminate all board specific drivers for custom and
        complex boards.
-   is not a firmware interface
    -   It might be part of a generic firmware interface, but on its own
        the device tree is just a data structure.
    -   does not replace ATAGS... but an FDT image can be passed via an
        ATAG.
    -   See "Competing Solutions" below
-   is not intended to be a universal interface.
    -   It is a useful data structure which solves several problems, but
        whether or not to use it is still up to the board port author.
-   is not an invasive change
    -   <s>No requirement to use FDT approach in a board port</s>
    -   Device Tree is required for new board support in the ARM
        architecture.
    -   No requirement to convert existing board ports
    -   No requirement to modify existing firmware

### History

-   [How device tree got into Linux and how it has
    evolved](../.././dev_portals/Device_Tree/Device_tree_history/Device_tree_history.md "Device tree history")

### Future

-   [How device tree is changing and where it is
    headed](../.././dev_portals/Device_Tree/Device_tree_future/Device_tree_future.md "Device tree future")

## Advantages

### for distributions

-   potentially fewer kernel images needed on an installer image (ie.
    for ARM netbooks)
    -   Ship one FDT image per machine (\<4k/machine) instead of 1
        kernel image per machine (\~1-2MB/machine) with a small number
        of sub-arch kernel images (ie. ARM11, CortexA8, CortexA9, etc).
    -   Becomes feasible for current installer image to boot on future
        hardware platforms using same chipset.
    -   Note: FDT is only part of the solution here. Some boot software
        is still required to select and pass in the correct FDT image.

### for System on Chip (SoC) vendors

-   Reduce or eliminate effort needed to write machine support code (ie
    arch/arm/mach-\*). Focus on device driver development instead.

### for board designers

-   Reduce effort required to port.
    -   SoC vendor supplied reference design binaries may also be
        bootable on custom machine.
-   No need to allocate a new global ARM machine id for each new board
    variant.
    -   Use the device tree \<vendor\>,\<boardname\> namespace instead
-   Most board specific code changes constrained to device tree file and
    device drivers.
-   Example: Xilinx FPGA toolchain has a tool to generate a device tree
    source file from the FPGA design files.
    -   Since the hardware description is constrained to the device tree
        source, FPGA engineers can test design changes without getting
        involved with kernel code.
    -   Alternately, kernel coders don't need to manually extract design
        changes from the FPGA design files.

### for embedded Linux ecosystem

-   smaller amount of board support code to merge
-   greater likelyhood of mainline support for boards from
    "uninterested" vendors
-   greater ability to correct poor board support by fixing or replacing
    broken FDT images.

### for firmware/bootloader developers

-   reduce impact of getting board description wrong (FDT stored as a
    separate image instead of statically linked into firmware). If
    initial release gets the board description wrong, then it is easily
    updated without a risky reflash of firmware.
-   expressive format to describe related board variants without
    allocating new machine numbers or new ATAGs.
-   Note: The FDT isn't a replacement to ATAGS, but does supplement
    them.

### Other advantages

-   Device tree source and FDTs can easily be machine generated and/or
    modified.
    -   Xilinx FPGA tools do device tree source generation
    -   U-Boot firmware can inspect and modify an FDT image before
        booting

## Competing Solutions

### board specific data structures

Some platforms use board-specific C data structures for passing data
from the bootloader to the kernel. Notable here is embedded PowerPC
support before standardizing on the FDT data format.

Experience with PowerPC demonstrated that using a custom C data
structure is certainly an expedient solution for small amounts of data,
but it causes maintainability issues in the long term and it doesn't
make any attempt to solve the problem of describing the board
configuration as a whole. Special cases tend to grow and there is no way
for the kernel to determine what specific version of the data structure
is passed to it. PowerPCs board info structure ended up being a mess of
\#ifdefs and ugly hacks, and it still only passed a handful of data like
memory size and Ethernet MAC addresses.

ATAGs have the elegance of providing an well defined namespace for
passing individual data items (memory regions, initrd address, etc) and
the operating system can reliably decode them. However, only a dozen or
so ATAGs are defined and is not expressive enough to describe the board
design. Using ATAGs essentially requires a separate machine number to be
allocated for each board variant, even if they are based on the same
design.

That being said, an ATAG is an ideal method for passing an FDT image to
the kernel in the same way an ATAG is used to pass the initrd address.

### ACPI

Firmware providing the [Advanced Configuration and Power
Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface)
exports a hardware description in the form of the Differentiated System
Description Table (DSDT). ACPI is found on x86 compatible systems and
has its roots in the original IBM PC BIOS.

### UEFI

The [Extensible Firmware
Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Firmware_Interface)
is an interface specification for passing control from a platforms
firmware to the operating system. It was designed by Intel as a
replacement for the PC BIOS interface.

ARM holdings is a [member](http://www.uefi.org/join/list) of the [United
EFI Forum](http://www.uefi.org/home). It is conceivable that there will
be an ARM implementation of UEFI.

### Open Firmware

[Open Firmware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware) is a
firmware interface specification designed by Sun in the late 1980's, and
ported to many architectures. It specifies a runtime OS client
interface, an cross platform device interface
([FCode](http://www.openfirmware.info/Forth/FCode)), a user interface,
and the Device Tree layout for describing the machine.

FDT is to Open Firmware what DSDT is to ACPI. The FDT reuses Open
Firmware's established device tree layout. In fact, Linux PowerPC
support uses the same codebase to support both Open Firmware and FDT
platforms.

### Some Notes on the Competing Solutions

Most of the competing solutions listed above provided feature rich
firmware interfaces including both machine description and runtime
services. Conversely, the FDT is only a data structure and doesn't
specify any firmware interface details. Board ports using the FDT are
typically booted from simple firmware implementations like U-Boot and
don't provide any form of runtime services.

A common design goal of the feature rich firmware interfaces is to
provide an abstract boot interface that factors away the differences
between different hardware platforms, at least enough for the OS to
initialize its own native device drivers. The idea is to be able to boot
'old' OS images on 'new' hardware, like how a Linux LiveCD image doesn't
have explicit knowledge of the hardware configuration, but relies on the
information provided to it by firmware.

Typical design goals for embedded firmware is to a) boot the OS as
quickly as possible, b) upgrade the OS image, and maybe c) provide some
low level debug support during initial board bringup. Focus tends to
shift away from firmware once the OS is bootable since the kernel
drivers the hardware directly (doesn't depend on firmware runtime
services). In fact, firmware updates are discouraged due to the risk of
rendering a board unbootable. ACPI, UEFI and OpenFirmware solutions,
while arguably 'better', often don't boot as fast, and are more complex
than required by the embedded system. In this regard the FDT approach
has the advantage due to its simplicity. ie. the FDT provides an
equivalently expressive way to describe hardware, but it works with
existing firmware and can be updated without reflashing firmware.

### Debugging

You can set CONFIG\_PROC\_DEVICETREE to be able to see the device tree
information in /proc after booting. Build the kernel with this option
set to 'Y', boot the kernel, then 'cd /proc/device-tree'

For newer kernels where the CONFIG\_PROC\_DEVICETREE option does not
exist, /proc/device-tree will be created if CONFIG\_PROC\_FS is set to
'Y'.

You might also try CONFIG\_DEBUG\_DRIVER=Y.

Also, often, you can set the line: "\#define DEBUG 1" to an individual C
file, to produce add debug statements to the routines in that file. This
will activate any pr\_debug() lines in the source for that file.

Alternatively, you can add the following to drivers/of/Makefile:

    CFLAGS_base.o := -DDEBUG
    CFLAGS_device.o := -DDEBUG
    CFLAGS_platform.o := -DDEBUG
    CFLAGS_fdt.o := -DDEBUG
