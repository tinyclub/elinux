# RMS100



Revelyâ€™s RMS100 Development board is the fastest way to start developing
your 32-bit ARM7 project.

Based on a LH75401 from Sharp's Blue-Streak family, the RMS100 offers a
huge range of I/O peripherals and a high performance CPU. The RMS100 is
available with a USB interface ( not currently supported under linux)
for high-speed data transfer at up to 921.6kbps. The USB cable also
provides power to the board during development. Applications are created
with cross-compilers such as GNU GCC.
