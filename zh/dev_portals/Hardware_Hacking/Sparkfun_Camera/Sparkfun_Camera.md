8-Bit Output Format Support:

-   `YCbCr 4:2:2`
-   `Bayer`

the [libdc1394 howto](http://eLinux.org/images/b/b1/Libdc1394.pdf "Libdc1394.pdf")
provides an excellent introduction to the Bayer format.

the starting row and column determine the Bayer format

-   even `BGGR`
-   odd `GRBG`

basically because the camera is slightly larger than 640x480 you can set
the window for usage:

-   Row 2 and Column 2 with Window Heigh 640 and Width 480 produces
    `Bayer BGGR`
-   Row 1 and Column 1 with Window Heigh 640 and Width 480 produces
    `Bayer GRBG`

the odd/even are dependent on the orientation of the scan.


 *Information gathered from the Sparkfun Forums*

although the camera does support a 16-bit mode, the ribbon cable only
provides support for the 8-bit mode.

    busonerd states - "My guess for the parts values would be a ~600ohm @ 100MHZ ferrite bead (B1 and B2), current capacity ~100-200 ma, and a 0.1uf caps(C1 and C2). You really can't go wrong with the ferrite bead - just get a higher impedance + higher current capacity one if in doubt. For the caps(C1 and C2) - if you really want to be paranoid, use an 0.47uf, an 0.1uf and an 0.01uf - with the smaller values nearer the connector - but that is guaranteed overkill."

-   the i2c interface needs to be level shifted from the 2.8v to either
    3.3v or 5v depending on your host device
