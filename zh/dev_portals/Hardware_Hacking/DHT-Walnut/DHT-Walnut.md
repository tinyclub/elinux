## Overview

DHT-Walnut is a shortened name for the Digital Home Technologies PCB
01070201 Rev. 1.1. The DHT-Walnut board is based on the AMCC-Walnut
(still available, and still expensiveÂ :P). It is a more improved board
described at www.amcc.com. A "walnut" searching will inform about
schematic and software. Also keep attention @ DENX: they have developed
a lot for the AMCC-Walnut board, and you could find a linux patch for
your problem, prettier documentation, developer suit, and much more: in
case, you are suggested to have a look to their web pages.

 The board consists of:

-   [PowerPC 405GP](http://eLinux.org/PPC405_GP "PPC405 GP") running at 266mhz
-   PC133 SDRAM slot, currently, only supports single sidded DIMMs
-   On-chip 405GP ethernet, board doesn't have an ethernet MAC address
-   DCE serial port, speeds up to 230k, only tested to 115200
-   two pci slots, keyed for 5V only cards
-   Promise Technologies [PDC20265](http://eLinux.org/PDC20265 "PDC20265") IDE
-   512k of boot flash AMD 29LV040B
    [datasheet](http://eLinux.org/images/0/0e/Amd29lv040b.pdf "Amd29lv040b.pdf")
-   12v dc powered
-   PPC40XX [JTAG](../../.././dev_portals/Glossary/JTAG/JTAG.md "JTAG") on J10
-   6.00" x 7.5" board size

The system's most common configuration seems to be:

-   System PCB
-   32M PC133 SDRAM DIMM
    -   Unknown PCI IEEE-1394 card supported by OHCI driver
    -   PPCBoot v.1.1.2 in flash

## Bootloaders

-   [ppcboot](http://eLinux.org/DHT-Walnut_PPCBoot "DHT-Walnut PPCBoot")

Here is the latest ppcboot 1.1.6 patch, as is, it will build for
flashing at 0xfff80000 as a replacement for the pcboot-1.1.2 that comes
with the board.

[patch-ppcboot-1.1.6-km2](http://eLinux.org/images/4/46/Patch-ppcboot-1.1.6-km2 "Patch-ppcboot-1.1.6-km2")

Original sources for ppcboot:
[[1]](ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/ppcboot/ppcboot-1.1.6.tar.bz2)

Here is a binary for those without a toolchain.

Bootloader](http://eLinux.org/DHT-Walnut_Installing_The_Updated_Bootloader "DHT-Walnut Installing The Updated Bootloader")

-   U-Boot

U-Boot is a significantly updated replacement for ppcboot. See: [U-Boot
for the DHT-Walnut](http://eLinux.org/DHT-Walnut_U_Boot "DHT-Walnut U Boot").

## Linux Kernels

-   Version 2.4

(Mostly) working kernel binary and config from jbevren with matrox fbcon
and usb input support.

Current issues:

-   -   USB keyboard input doesnt seem to work, but events reach
        /dev/input/event0
    -   [Media:uImage](http://eLinux.org/images/c/c2/UImage "UImage")
    -   [Media:config](http://eLinux.org/images/f/fa/Config "Config")

-   Version 2.6

See: [2.6 Linux kernel for the
DHT-Walnut](http://eLinux.org/DHT-Walnut_2.6_Linux_Kernel "DHT-Walnut 2.6 Linux Kernel")

## Userland

-   [Debian GNU/Linux netboot
    installer](http://eLinux.org/DHT-Walnut_-Debian_Install "DHT-Walnut -Debian Install")
