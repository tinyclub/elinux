A fast, flexible solution for embedded developers.

General Description

405GP/GPR Product Photo The AMCC [PowerPC](http://eLinux.org/PowerPC "PowerPC") 405GP and
405GPr family of 32-bit RISC processors is designed to provide a
flexible, fast time-to- market hardware solution to satisfy the demands
of high-performance embedded applications. Implemented in the scalable
PowerPC architecture, the 405GP and 405GPr processors maintain code
compatibility with other PowerPC processors for ease in migration and
faster time-to-market. An optimized balance of performance, low power,
and features makes them ideal solutions for communication, data storage,
and pervasive computing applications.

The 405GP and 405GPr processors support speeds of up to 266MHz and
400MHz respectively. Both incorporate a rich mix of features, such as a
PCI interface, an SDRAM Controller, a 64-bit on-chip
[CoreConnect](http://eLinux.org/CoreConnect "CoreConnect") bus, Ethernet and other
on-chip peripheral support, and the IBM
[CodePack](http://eLinux.org/CodePack "CodePack")™ code compression engine. In addition,
power management features, a small form factor, and low power
consumption make the AMCC 405 processor family an ideal platform for
applications ranging from networking to video.
