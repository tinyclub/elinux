Ken McGuire got his on 3/15/2003 and found the following:

-   the serial port operates at 38400 baud.
-   Hold down the menu and info button, keep holding them while plugging
    in the box, "boot" will appear (after about 5 seconds of holding) on
    the display and some stuff will come out the serial port.
-   the cursor and channel buttons will cycle through a menu: cold,
    hunt, disp, n dl, run.
-   pressing select at each ot the menu items will do something, and
    produce data on the RS-232 port.
-   there is a reset button inside that does the same as powering on.
    labelled SW900.
-   holding just the menu button during reset gets the "boot" display
    without any serial port activity.
-   the "pcmcia slot" connects to the motherboard via a 24 pin connector
    J402, so it's probably not true, or complete PCMCIA.
-   there is no video out of any of the outputs, VGA, S-VID, video out.
-   JTAG comes out to J7, a 10 pin header with half the pins grounded.
-   pin-out at: [JTAG
    pin-out](http://www.paonia.com/~kenm/Pix/images/DCT5000/J7.jpg)
-   J7 with connector (it's a .050" spacing): [J7conn
    picture](http://www.paonia.com/~kenm/Pix/images/DCT5000/J7conn.jpg)

Here is what comes out the serial port at boot time:

T0mW found that while holding the INFO button down while powering up, or
RESET, it will give a verbose debug of the frequencies it is "hunting"
on.

MonMotha got his DCT5000 on 3/19/2003. I haven't done much with it other
than take the top off, but I'll update this page as I go. So far I'm
just attempting to find some of the missing doc links.

sorphin got both of his DCT-5000's on 3/18/2003, and is doing some
digging, also found this link
[[1]](http://24.125.76.224:8000/www.cableboxen.prjct) to a page where a
guy is working on mapping out how the DCT-2000 and 5000 work.

Here's a list of test points, add to them as they are discovered:

-   TP9 (next to the CPU, towards the back): Pin 76 of CPU - Sys Clock
-   TP11 (Next to U33): SDRAM Clock
-   TP510: Ground

Notes [TimRiker](http://eLinux.org/User:TimRiker "User:TimRiker") "found":

Connect a straight-through serial cable from the COM1 port on the host
computer to the RS-232 port on the target system. Make sure that the
RS-232 connector is attached to internal connector labelled J800.
9600-8-n-1

Power ON the target board. When it boots, a \# prompt appears.

Enter the following commands at the \# prompt:

    export BOOTFILE=vmlinus
    export BOOTHOST=
    export NETADDR=
    export NETMASK=
    export BROADCAST=
    export ETHERHWADDR=

[TimRiker](http://eLinux.org/User:TimRiker "User:TimRiker") is not sure if this is after
installing a different ROM or something... Still looking.

Ken McGuire searches through the binary images of Tim's ROM and [the
original ROM](http://www.eLinux.org/datafiles/DTC5000.rom.bz2) and
doesn't find any of the above strings. Nothing comes out his DCT5000's
J800 on power-up either.

Here's the DOCSIS configuration file of the box:

    NetworkAccess = Yes

    Start ClassOfService
    ClassID = 1
    MaxRateDown = 1500000
    MaxRateUp = 128000
    PriorityUp = 1
    GuaranteedUp = 1280
    MaxBurstUp = 0
    PrivacyEnable = Yes
    EndOf ClassOfService

    MaxCPE = 4
