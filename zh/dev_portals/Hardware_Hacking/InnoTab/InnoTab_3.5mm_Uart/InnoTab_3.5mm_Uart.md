# Introduction

This procedure has been documented in a way that someone who has very
little experience with soldering or board modification should be able to
accomplish the mod. In addition the parts chosen have been selected due
to the availability, ease of use, and cost.

Note: If you use a 2.5mm stereo socket instead of the 3.5mm one, you can
use the many "Motorola T191" and compatible cables as they are used with
[OsmocomBB](http://bb.osmocom.org/) and a varity of other
[Osmocom](http://osmocom.org/) projects. The cables are also often
available cheaper than the 3.5mm cable from Digikey linked below.
