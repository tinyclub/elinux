Half a dozen companies around the world are shipping tiny Linux-based
wireless access points (WAPs) with built-in file and printer servers.
The WAPs appear to run a 2.4-series Linux kernel ... The design appears
to be based on RDC Semiconductor's R8610, a 133MHz RISC-based SoC that
executes the i486 instruction set at about 44 bogoMIPS.

... 16KB of L1 cache, a 33MHz PCI bus, an external SDRAM/ROM/memory
controller, IPC (internal peripheral controller) with DMA and IRQ
timer/counter, a 10/100 Ethernet MAC, FIFO UART, and USB 2.0 host
controller. ... 32MB of SDRAM, 4MB of Flash, and support user-supplied
2.5-inch (laptop-sized) hard drives formated with FAT, FAT32, or ext2.
Claimed wireless throughputs up to 6MB/s ...

... an 802.11G [WiFi](http://eLinux.org/WiFi "WiFi") interface supporting WPA and WEP
encryption. The interface can be configured as a wireless client, access
point, WDS bridge, or WDS repeater ...

Dual USB 2.0 ports can be used to connect memory card readers ... The
ports also support USB OTG ("on the go") [and] LPR print server software
for USB printers.

Designs believed to be based on the RDC SoC include:
