Boards The entire system is composed of 4 boards. Most electrolytics are
through hole. However, there are a few scattered tantalums.

       * There is a main board with the CPU, memory, and flash, and a SD socket. There is a cylinder shaped crystal (probally 32KHz, watch xtal) and a 28.6363Mhz xtal.
       * There is a board that has the AV inputs on one side.
       * On the otherside, there is a board with a mini USB connector.
       * A 4th board sits on top of 2 sets of fine (0.05 or finer) headers.
