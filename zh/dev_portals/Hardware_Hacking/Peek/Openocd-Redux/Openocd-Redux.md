# Openocd-Redux



**This project appears to be dead as of Jan. 2014. I'll leave this page
for historical purposes. Links are likely broken.**

[OpenOCD-Redux](http://projects.linuxtogo.org/projects/openocd-redux/)
is based on the original [OpenOCD](http://openocd.berlios.de/web/) with
the intention of remaining extremely light, flexible, stable, and easy
to use. It's based on OpenOCD version r729.
