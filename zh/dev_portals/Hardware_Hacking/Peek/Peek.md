### Discussions about the Current OS

-   It's a lightweight, purpose-built OS called PeekUX.
    [[1]](http://www.geekypeek.com/?p=13)
    -   Starts with TI's very own version of the real-time OS called
        Nucleus ( by
        [Mentor](http://www.mentor.com/products/embedded_software/nucleus_rtos/)
        )
    -   TI has compiled in device drivers, and other stacks and turned
        it into their own platform.
    -   Peek SW developers then took what TI gave them and wrap it with
        their own proprietary GUI and network libraries to create
        Peekux.
    -   The email application then runs on top of that.
    -   The whole thing is built as a single image. Thus the distinction
        between OS and App is blurred.
-   "Hacking maybe difficult" article at Peek Forums.
    [[2]](http://www.peekforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=38)

### Wireless Network and FCC stuff

-   Uses [T-Mobile's](http://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/pcc.aspx)
    nationwide GSM network.
-   Also can use AT&T's GSM network as a secondary network.
-   [FCC ID](http://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/) is listed as: V6LPEEK0001
-   Uses the GSM850 band. TX: 824-848MHz RX: 869-893MHz
-   Maximum RF Radiated Power (GPRS850): 26dBm EIRP
-   RX Sensitivity: -109dBmÂ ?
-   Antenna: PIFA type

### Mail Handling

-   Currently, the very large computing resources at [Amazon
    AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/) (Seattle, WA) is being used
    to handle the mail polling and forwarding for the Peek users. The
    mail handler was worked out at Peek HQ and then unleashed at AWS.
    AWS's "EC2 Service" is immensely flexible and allows Peek to keep up
    with the growing user base.

### Battery

-   Model: PK-BAT-001
-   Voltage: 3.7V
-   Capacity: 700mAh
-   Maximum Charge Voltage:4.2V
-   Standard: GB/T18287-2000

### Peek Accessories

-   Upgrade Cable for upgrade/hacking (No longer available).
-   Replacement Battery (No longer available).

### Opening the Case

-   The case has 4 tiny "torx" style screws. The size is T6. You will
    need a [Precision Torx Screwdriver](http://amzn.com/B000FGQ1G6) set.
-   Obviously, opening your Peek **voids the warranty**.
-   There are 3 tiny screws immediately visible when you take off
    battery cover. And the fourth screw is hidden under the red "Do not
    remove" sticker.
-   After the screws are removed, start from bottom of unit and
    carefully pry the top and bottom housings apart.
-   To understand what I mean, see this picture from [Maushammer on
    Flickr.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/8728129@N05/2855253340/sizes/l/in/set-72157607274454694/)
    On the left side of image is the bottom housing. Notice the four
    screw holes. The rest of the housing attaches with tabs that easily
    pry apart.

### Debugging/Programming Tools

-   [Micro to Mini USB
    Adapter](http://www.gsm-support.net/mini-usb----micro-usb-converter-p1298.en.html)
    (does not convert the UART to USB)
-   [Flyswatter USB JTAG Debugger](../../.././dev_portals/Hardware_Hacking/Flyswatter/Flyswatter.md "Flyswatter") for
    upgrade/hacking
-   [OpenOCD JTAG Debugger Software](http://eLinux.org/Openocd-Redux "Openocd-Redux") --
    currently doenst know anything about the LoCosto chips.
-   [UART TTL to USB
    Adapter](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=718)
    for upgrade/hacking
-   [J-Link USB JTAG/SWD
    debugger](http://iar.com/website1/1.0.1.0/369/1/) from IAR Systems.
    [User's
    Guide](http://ftp.iar.se/WWWfiles/jlink/J-Link_J-TraceARM-2.pdf)
-   Same J-Link product from [Segger
    USA](http://www.segger.com/cms/jlink.html)
-   [Cheap but decent Benchtop DC Power
    Supply](http://mouser.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?qs=ah0KxwAvRCGaWslNAMTDfg%3d%3d)
    from Extech Instruments. This will save you from needing to keep
    charged batteries around.

### External MicroUSB Charge/Upgrade port

This is the MicroUSB port that is exposed on the left side of the
peek.
 It's used for both charging and upgrading the Peek. The upgrade cable
uses
 a serial TTL to USB level shifter to convert the serial TTL into a USB
com port.
 a bootlog can be viewed using serial settings 115200,n,8,1

### Internal UART Header

This is on the inside of the Peek under the SIM (this is also covered by
the warranty sticker).

 **Note:** This is not a new, hidden serial port. This port is
electrically the same as the External Charger/Upgrade port shown
above.

### JTAG Pads (vias)

These vias are found on the bottom side of printed circuit board just
below the white antenna strip.
 **\*Note: You will need to remove the solder mask and solder small wire
to the vias. 26AWG or 30AWG is best.
** Obviously, the four signals TDO, TMS, TCK, and TDI are the most
important ones. Connect these signals straight to your JTAG dongle.
 You should also pick up a Ground signal somewhere near the DC Power
circuity on the lower left section of PCB.
 Perhaps, depending on your JTAG dongle, you could also power the Peek
from the dongle itself. Â ;-)
 [![Peekjtag3.png](http://eLinux.org/images/1/10/Peekjtag3.png)](http://eLinux.org/File:Peekjtag3.png)
 Thanks to "codeman" and "prpplague" for this (these pinouts may be
wrong!).

## uClinux

### Bootloader

-   a bootloader, such as [U-Boot](../../.././dev_portals/Development_Platforms/Tegra/Mainline_SW/U-Boot/Tegra/Mainline_SW/U-Boot.md "U-Boot") or
    [APEX](http://eLinux.org/APEX "APEX"), will be needed to facilitate booting uClinux
-   low level access to Flash memory via JTAG is now doable. ( see above
    )
-   U-Boot could be used, but is pretty large
-   APEX is small, configurable, and easily adapted for ARM7TDMI

### Kernel

-   mainline kernel has the [basic support for
    ARM7TDMI](http://opensrc.sec.samsung.com/) core
-   need basic support for the TCS2310
-   [STMPE2401 keypad
    driver](http://eLinux.org/images/6/62/Stmpe2401-20090923.patch "Stmpe2401-20090923.patch")
    for linux-2.6 git (20090923) posted by Cfriedt
-   [stmpe24xx project page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/stmpe24xx)
    on SourceForge.net

### Root Filesystem

-   use [Buildroot](http://buildroot.busybox.net/) for initial testing
-   use [uClibc](http://www.uclibc.org/) as core C library
-   use [BusyBox](../../.././dev_portals/Boot_Time/BusyBox/BusyBox.md "BusyBox") as basic utilities for testing

### Tools

-   use CSST ( Cellular Systems Software Tools ) from TI for loading
    Flash with bootloader etc. This is the [Release
    Notes](http://focus.ti.com/download/wtbu/csst_sdp2430_releasenotes_v1_2.pdf)
    for the CSST included in SDP2430 (OMAP2430). There is a CSST for the
    TI LoCosto chips included with the [Peek
    Upgrader](http://drop.io/PeekFiles) software from Peek. More
    detailed info on CSST can be found
    [here.](http://wiki.davincidsp.com/index.php/CSST)

The Peek update program calls a command line CSST app to actually load
the new firmware to flash. In my case, the command line was:

     D:\apps\Peek\CSST\csstcli.exe -t 1 -op download -i D:\apps\Peek\software\Rel_01_09_10.m0 -dt NOR -p COM5

This command can be executed from a command prompt. You will be prompted
to reset the Peek (remove and replace the battery, then hit the power
button) and the download will begin!

-   use TMSH to execute commands on the Peek itself
    ([source](http://peek.jr9.org/TMSH-and-accessing-you-Peek-internal-memory-td1724226.html)):

Your Peek must remain active during the processing of each command so
you may need to move the scroll wheel or press a button intermittently
during the process to keep it on. You must also have the Peek cable and
Peek upgrade software installed on your computer before you start.

Power on Peek and connect Peek to PC using the Peek Upgrade cable.
Determine wich port the Peek is connected to. Either Check Device
Manager - Start \> Run \> devmgmt.msc OR right click My Computer \>
Properties \> Hardware Tab and Look at LPT&COMM, expand + sign and you
should see what COMM port your cable is on

Open a command prompt. If you plan on copying files to the computer you
must right click "Command prompt" and run it as an administrator even if
you are already logged on as an administrator. It should be located
under "Accessories" in the start menu.

Type in:

    cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Peek.1.10.00\tmsh" (or whatever your Peek directory is called)

Then type:

    tmsh -psX -ttlocosto

Where X = your COMM port \# from earlier.
