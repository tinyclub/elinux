# Automotive Communications



Modern Toyota automobiles typically have 3 major bus systems: the CAN
bus, the BEAN bus, and the AVC-LAN bus. Each of the system buses must
inter-operate with the other system buses, so we need a basic
understanding of them. All of the bus systems consist of some “backbone”
of a bus network and many individual nodes or Electronic Control Units
(ECU) such as amplifiers, receivers, CD-changers, automatic locks, or
any other component.
