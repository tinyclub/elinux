# CR48-updatebeta0.9.128.14



Google is in the process of pushing out an update to Chrome OS on the
Cr-48. This updates from 0.9.128.12 to 0.9.128.14. The update file
weighs in at just 5mb. No formal Changelog has been released for the
full Chrome OS system but the Chrome Browser Releases blog does show the
browser changes in this update, one of them a critical security fix.
Also, digging through the Chromium Issues site shows that an issue
preventing Google Apps users with a period in their username from
logging in has been fixed. It seems an audio garbling bug has crept in
somewhere. The current workaround is to just reboot the Cr-48 when the
garbling starts. Hopefully we'll see a fix out soon.
