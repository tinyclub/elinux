# CR48-proxy-settings-issue



# Proxy settings take forever to detect

One of my biggest gripes so far with the CR48, is waiting for it to
detect proxy settings anytime the wifi reconnects. Every time it comes
out of suspend, it takes way to long to discover I'm not (and never) use
a proxy, before it will let me do anything online.

I was unable to find a place in the settings where I could change this,
but I stumbled across
[chrome://settings/proxy](http://chrome://settings/proxy) which lets you
default it to direct connection!

 Now my chromebook works a lot faster coming out of standby and getting
back on the net!
