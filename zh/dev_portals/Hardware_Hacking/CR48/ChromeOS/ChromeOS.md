# ChromeOS



[Google's](http://www.google.com) Chrome OS is an open source,
lightweight operating system that will initially be targeted at x86 and
[ARM](http://www.arm.com/) based netbooks. Chrome OS is a new project,
separate from [Android](http://eLinux.org/Android "Android") and was [initially
announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html)
in July 2009. Like with Chromium and Chrome, ChromiumOS is the open
source release of ChromeOs.


 ChromeOS is currently still under development, but Google has released
its first version, together with a development platform called
[CR48](http://eLinux.org/CR48 "CR48"). You can get your hands on one of these through the
[pilot program](http://www.google.com/chromeos/pilot-program-cr48.html).

There is some quite extensive documentation about working on and with
ChromeOs on the [ChromiumOS project
page](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os)
