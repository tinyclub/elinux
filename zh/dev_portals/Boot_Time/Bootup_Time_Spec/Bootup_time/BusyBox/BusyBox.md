# BusyBox



Busybox is a program with small memory footprint, designed to replace a
suite of otherwise large Linux utilities. It is commonly used in
embedded Linux systems. Over 58 projects are listed on the [busybox
projects page](http://www.busybox.net/products.html).

The text segment is only loaded once. Subsequent calls to subprograms
use the same text segment, saving memory.

Additionally, it is highly configurable. Only the required applets are
compiled in reducing storage requirements.
