# ARM920T



The ARM920T and ARM922T hard macrocells are suitable for a wide range of
platform OS based applications. Based around the high performance
ARM9TDMI 32-bit RISC CPU, the ARM920T and ARM922T processors feature
instruction and data caches, memory management unit (MMU) enabling
support for all major operating systems (OS), AMBAÂ® bus-compliant
interfaces, and support for ARM's real-time trace technology with the
optional ETM9TM Embedded Trace Macrocell. The ARM922T is identical to
the ARM920T but has 8K/8K caches while the ARM920T has 16K/16K caches.

The ARM922T processor is available via the ARM Foundry Program.
