# MontaVista



[MontaVista](http://www.mvista.com) was founded by [James F.
Ready](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ready), an acknowledged
pioneer in the off-the-shelf operating-systems business with more than
25 years of experience in the embedded-software industry. While at Ready
Systems in the early 1990s, he foresaw that Linux would become an
important factor in the embedded market. The Ready Systems merger with
Microtec Research and subsequent acquisition, in 1995, by Mentor
Graphics afforded Jim Ready the opportunity to pursue his vision with
the creation of [MontaVista](http://www.mvista.com).

[MontaVista](http://www.mvista.com) is headquartered in Santa Clara,
California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. The name MontaVista Software
comes from the company's first location, in Monta Vista, an
unincorporated area in Cupertino, CA.
