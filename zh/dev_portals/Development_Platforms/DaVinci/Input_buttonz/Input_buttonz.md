# EVM input buttons


(Redirected from [Input
buttonz](http://eLinux.org/index.php?title=Input_buttonz&redirect=no "Input buttonz"))


If you would like some input buttons for your evm you can solder some
push buttons right onto the board.

Just connect them between the LEDs [REF CHECK WHICH SIDE OF LED!] and
ground.

If you want to retain LED functionality, just send a command to turn off
the LED prior to polling for the input status, otherwise you will read
the output value rather than the switch!
