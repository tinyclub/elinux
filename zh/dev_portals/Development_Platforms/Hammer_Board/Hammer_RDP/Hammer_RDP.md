# Hammer RDP



Hammer-RDP stands for Hammer Robotics Development Platform. This is a
new carrier board for Hammer being developed by TinCanTools for the
Robotics, Process Control, and general interfacing and hobbiest market.

Main Features:

    * Small size - just 3" x 3", ideal for space constrained applications.
    * Stackable add on boards can be created for custom applications such as process control, home automation, robotics, etc.
    * Three pin headers for all GPIO connections, allowing easy interfacing to sensors, servos, and other devices using this pin arrangement.
    * Jumperable dual voltage selection for all GPIO connections - 3.3V or 5V. Pins can be jumpered for either voltage in sets of four.
    * Dual voltage (3.3V and 5V) I2C bus.
    * 8 channel, 12 bit analog inputs via SPI
    * Most Hammer signals, including I2C and USB, are available on the stacking connector.

Possible add on boards you might create for the Hammer-RDP:

    * Prototyping Board
    * Single USB Host 4 port Hub with on board Flyswatter JTAG
    * Sound Board with additional analog inputs and GPIOs
    * Your application specific interface board

The only limitation is your imagination!
