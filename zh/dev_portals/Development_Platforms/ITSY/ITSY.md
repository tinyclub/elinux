# ITSY



The Itsy pocket computer is a flexible research platform whose primary
objective is to enable hardware and software research in pocket
computing, including low-power hardware, power management, operating
systems, wireless networking, user interfaces, and applications.

Itsy's CPU is a StrongARM SA-1100 processor (developed by Digital
Equipment Corporation's Digital Semiconductor division, which became
part of Intel in May 1998). Itsy contains 16 megabytes of DRAM and 4
megabytes of Flash memory. The main crystal frequency is 3.6864 MHz
which, using the processor's phase-locked loop (PLL), results in a
variable CPU core frequency from 59.0 MHz to 206.4 MHz.
