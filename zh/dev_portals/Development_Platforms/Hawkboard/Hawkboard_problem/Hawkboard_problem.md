# Hawkboard problem




 Hello all,

There is a problem with many HawkBoards shipped from July through
October 2010 by Farnell, Special Computing, IDA and Innovate Software
Solutions. These boards are unable to boot Linux® operating system.
Others who have boards that don't fall under this period can continue
your development.

How to identify this board? Your OMAP version will be "OMAPL138" and DDR
version reads "D9LHR"

If you have XOMAPL138, then you are safe..

HawkBoard.org and TI are investigating the situation in more detail and
will work with you to ensure all faulty boards are fixed. We will post
periodic updates on [this mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/hawkboard) as we work to resolve
the issue.

Please help us prioritize and suggest alternatives to keep you going.

Copy below heading and answer as given below in the example.

-   No. of hawkboards you have
-   Purchased from (Disty name)
-   Do you have a working version to continue
-   What you want to use hawkboard for (prototype, learning, product,
    etc)
-   Do you have an alternate platform to try out (Beagle, Leopard, ...)
