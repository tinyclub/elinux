# Introduction

From
[http://www.marvell.com/products/embedded\_processors/developer/kirkwood/sheevaplug.jsp](http://www.marvell.com/products/embedded_processors/developer/kirkwood/sheevaplug.jsp):

The SheevaPlug is a development platform, targeted for use as a plug
computer, and designed to run network-based software services. It
features a Kirkwood Series SoC with an embedded Marvell Sheeva™ CPU core
running at 1.2 GHz. This device connects to the network using GbE,
offers desktop class performance, and can be used to replace a PC-based
home server for many applications. Peripherals connect using the
included USB 2.0 port.

The development kit is enclosed in a plastic case that also contains a
universal power supply. For developers a USB-based debug connection is
included to enable simple debugging and reprogramming.
