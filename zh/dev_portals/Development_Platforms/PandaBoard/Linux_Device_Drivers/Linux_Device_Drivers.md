#### First Edition

#### Second Edition

Adding Jonathan Corbet as author.

Second edition of this book is [freely available
online](http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/).

It details the 2.4 kernel series.

#### Third Edition

The third edition, adding Greg Kroah-Hartman as an author discusses
driver development for the 2.6.10 kernel.

Therefore, the book by now is significantly out of date, but Jonathan
has kept a list of all things changing since then at the
[LWN.net](http://lwn.net) site: [API changes in the 2.6 kernel
series](http://lwn.net/Articles/2.6-kernel-api/).

This book also is [freely available
online](http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/). Please consider buying the "dead
tree" version to support the authors.
