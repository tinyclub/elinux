**Christopher Hallinan, Prentice Hall PTR, ISBN-13: 978-0131679849**

Hallinan begins by touring a typical Linux-based embedded system,
introducing key concepts and components, and calling attention to
differences between Linux and traditional embedded environments. Writing
from the embedded developer’s viewpoint, he addresses issues ranging
from kernel building and initialization to bootloaders, device drivers
to file systems.

This book covers the increasingly popular BusyBox utilities; presents a
step-by-step walkthrough of porting Linux to custom boards; and
introduces real-time configuration via CONFIG\_RT--one of today’s most
exciting developments in embedded Linux. You’ll find especially detailed
coverage of using development tools to analyze and debug embedded
systems--including the art of kernel debugging.

-   Understand the details of the Linux kernel initialization process
-   Learn about the special role of bootloaders in embedded Linux
    systems, with specific emphasis on U-Boot
-   Use embedded Linux file systems, including JFFS2--with detailed
    guidelines for building Flash-resident file system images
-   Understand the Memory Technology Devices subsystem for flash (and
    other) memory devices
-   Master gdb, KGDB, and hardware JTAG debugging
-   Learn many tips and techniques for debugging within the Linux kernel
-   Maximize your productivity in cross-development environments
-   Prepare your entire development environment, including TFTP, DHCP,
    and NFS target servers
-   Configure, build, and initialize BusyBox to support your unique
    requirements

There is a reason this book has been the \#1 book on [Amazon embedded
systems](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/3730) for more than
two years now!
