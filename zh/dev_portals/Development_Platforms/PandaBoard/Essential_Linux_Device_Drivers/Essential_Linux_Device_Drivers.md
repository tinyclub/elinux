Development Series,** [ISBN

This book does a very decent attempt at describing everything you need
to know about Linux driver development.

From the Amazon website:

-   Addresses drivers discussed in no other book, including drivers for
    I2C, video, sound, PCMCIA, and different types of flash memory
-   Demystifies essential kernel services and facilities, including
    kernel threads and helper interfaces
-   Teaches polling, asynchronous notification, and I/O control
-   Introduces the Inter-Integrated Circuit Protocol for embedded Linux
    drivers
-   Covers multimedia device drivers using the Linux-Video subsystem and
    Linux-Audio framework
-   Shows how Linux implements support for wireless technologies such as
    Bluetooth, Infrared, WiFi, and cellular networking
-   Describes the entire driver development lifecycle, through debugging
    and maintenance
-   Includes reference appendixes covering Linux assembly, BIOS calls,
    and Seq files

Be sure to also visit [the book's homepage](http://elinuxdd.com/) as it
contains misc updates, errata, source code, etc...

#### User comments

Comment from Alan Cox “Probably the most wide ranging and complete Linux
device driver book I’ve read.”.

Comment from [User:Kaa-ching](http://eLinux.org/User:Kaa-ching "User:Kaa-ching"): I
really liked the book. It is up-to-date (at least early 2008 it was :-)
) and comprehensive.

Comment from
[User:ThomasPetazzoni](http://eLinux.org/User:ThomasPetazzoni "User:ThomasPetazzoni") :
This book is a nice addition to the traditional [Linux Device
Drivers](http://eLinux.org/Linux_Device_Drivers "Linux Device Drivers"). Not only because
it is more up-to-date, but also because it covers a wider range of
drivers. However, reading Linux Device Drivers first is probably
recommended. In the end, I think both books are very complementary.
