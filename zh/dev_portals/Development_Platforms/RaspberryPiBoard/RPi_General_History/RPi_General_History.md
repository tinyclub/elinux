This page is intended to show why the Raspberry Pi was created, and why
it is what it is, by highlighting relevant events in its history. It is
not intended to be a detailed history; that is covered elsewhere.

If you add to this page, please include a link to the original source of
each item, so the full story can be read, and only provide a summary
here. Avoid adding announcements; wait until that event has happened
before reporting it.

## Full history

If you want to read the full history of the Raspberry Pi, there are
several places you can go.

-   The [Raspberry Pi Foundation](http://http://www.raspberrypi.org/)
    website, which includes the news blog archives.

-   The [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi)

-   The Raspberry Pi community provides contributions, such as [simple
    tutorials](http://eLinux.org/RPi_Tutorials "RPi Tutorials") and [more complex
    projects](http://eLinux.org/RPi_Projects "RPi Projects"), although several of these
    may not be complete yet.

-   For fun, check the [history of the BBC Micro
    Computer](http://www.reghardware.com/2011/11/30/bbc_micro_model_b_30th_anniversary/),
    given as part of the inspiration behind the Raspberry Pi

## Hardware history

To understand the hardware, consult the [design
changes](http://eLinux.org/Rpi_HardwareHistory "Rpi HardwareHistory") page for how the
Raspberry Pi has evolved, and the [manufacturing
differences](http://eLinux.org/RaspberryPi_Boards "RaspberryPi Boards") page that may
help if you are having problems with your board.

## Birth of the idea

The Raspberry Pi Foundation, on the [About
page](http://www.raspberrypi.org/about) of the official website, states
why the Raspberry Pi project began. The text is reproduced here, so it
can be preserved:

*The idea behind a tiny and cheap computer for kids came in 2006, when
Eben Upton and his colleagues at the University of Cambridge’s Computer
Laboratory, including Rob Mullins, Jack Lang and Alan Mycroft, became
concerned about the year-on-year decline in the numbers and skills
levels of the A Level students applying to read Computer Science in each
academic year. From a situation in the 1990s where most of the kids
applying were coming to interview as experienced hobbyist programmers,
the landscape in the 2000s was very different; a typical applicant might
only have done a little web design.*

*Something had changed the way kids were interacting with computers. A
number of problems were identified: the colonisation of the ICT
curriculum with lessons on using Word and Excel, or writing webpages;
the end of the dot-com boom; and the rise of the home PC and games
console to replace the Amigas, BBC Micros, Spectrum ZX and Commodore 64
machines that people of an earlier generation learned to program on.*

*There isn’t much any small group of people can do to address problems
like an inadequate school curriculum or the end of a financial bubble.
But we felt that we could try to do something about the situation where
computers had become so expensive and arcane that programming
experimentation on them had to be forbidden by parents; and to find a
platform that, like those old home computers, could boot into a
programming environment. From 2006 to 2008, Eben designed several
versions of what has now become the Raspberry Pi; you can see one of the
earliest prototypes here.*

*By 2008, processors designed for mobile devices were becoming more
affordable, and powerful enough to provide excellent multimedia, a
feature we felt would make the board desirable to kids who wouldn’t
initially be interested in a purely programming-oriented device. The
project started to look very realisable. Eben (now a chip architect at
Broadcom), Rob, Jack and Alan, teamed up with Pete Lomas, MD of hardware
design and manufacture company Norcott Technologies, and David Braben,
co-author of the seminal BBC Micro game Elite, to form the Raspberry Pi
Foundation to make it a reality.*

## Design Constraints

To meet the original requirements, there were several design issues to
be resolved. The prime requirement was to keep within the price limit
they had set, and to provide a device that would allow its users to
experiment with the hardware and software. They expected that some of
the omissions would be added by the user community. The limitations this
created are revealed in the following interviews:

-   A [Question and
    Answer](http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/11/09/14/1554243/Eben-Upton-Answers-Your-Questions#comments)
    session held with Eben Upton on 14 September, 2011, on the Slashdot
    website covered some of the design issues.

-   An
    [interview](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/09/raspberry-pi-insider-exclusive-sellout-to-sell-out/)
    with engineer Pete Lomas reveals why some of those decisions were
    taken.

## How the Foundation, and the Raspberry Pi, developed

Some of the early experiences are given in a three part blog by Russell
Davis (aka forum admin ukscone). Read them individually: [Part
1](http://russelldavis.org/2012/01/14/the-raspberry-pi-part-one/), [Part
2](http://russelldavis.org/2012/01/17/the-raspberry-pi-part-two/,) and
[Part
3](http://russelldavis.org/2012/01/25/the-raspberry-pi-part-three/,).

This covers the timeline of key events in the development of the
Foundation and the Raspberry Pi:

BCM2835 to a BCM2836, the speed is increased from 700MHz to 900MHz with
a quad core instead of a single core. It will also run Windows 10 as
well as various Linux distributions. Reported on raspberrypi.org,
