Raspberry Pi has appointed
[Farnell](http://www.element14.com/raspberrypi), [RS
Components](http://rswww.com) and (recently) [Egoman Technology
Corp](http://www.egoman.com.cn/)<sup>[[1]](#cite_note-1)</sup> as its
authorised manufacturing partners & distributors.

As of July 16th 2012, both [Premier
Farnell](http://www.element14.com/raspberrypi) and [RS
Components](http://rswww.com) have removed their "one per customer"
restriction. Both consumers and businesses alike should now be able to
buy bulk stock of the Raspberry Pi.

Raspberry Pi's distributors will ship worldwide to the best of their
ability (ie subject to origin export and local import laws).

Countries that are currently subject to UK (including EU and UN) export
restrictions include North Korea, Iran, Ivory Coast, Liberia and
Zimbabwe. A full list and further details are provided at
[[1]](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?topicId=1084100244)

Farnell have also been refusing to sell direct to some consumers in the
EU, to the best of my knowledge they have not given full details of why.

There are three main options for buying a Raspberry Pi, buying direct
from the distributor, buying from a subsidary or sister company of the
distributor or buying from a third party reseller which option is best
will depend on the location of the customer, the number of Raspberry
Pi's being purchased, and the urgency of the order.

All new orders from the main distributors should now be filled with
512 MB rev 2 Raspberry Pi's. However, some third-party resellers may
still have stock of the older models.

Note that stock status may change quickly. It may be worth checking a
local supplier even if they are listed as out of stock here.

## Main distributors and subsidaries/sister companies

## Farnell

[http://www.farnell.com/](http://www.farnell.com/) Farnell are one of
the two main distributors. The order code for the Raspberry Pi is
2191863.

### Element14

[http://www.element14.com](http://www.element14.com) The "Element14"
brand is used by a number of different operations within the Premier
Farnell group and is also used for the groups "social" operation. In the
Asia-Pacific region the Element 14 brand has completely replaced the
previous "Premier Electronics" brand for asia and the previous "Farnell"
brand for australia and new-zealand. In Europe, the Element14 brand is
used in paralell with the Farnell brand. In North america the Element14
brand is used in parallel with the Newark brand.

### Newark

[http://www.newark.com/](http://www.newark.com/) Newark is the main
American branch of the Premier Farnell group (Farnell's parent company).

[http://tw.element14.com/](http://tw.element14.com/)
[http://th.element14.com/](http://th.element14.com/) Element14 have
warehouses in Singapore and Shanghi. It appears that some countries are
served from both warehouses while others are served from only one or the
other. UK stock is also listed on these sites. The order code for the
Raspberry Pi is 2191863.

### CPC

[http://cpc.farnell.com/](http://cpc.farnell.com/)

Ohio.

## RS components

[http://rswww.com/](http://rswww.com/) RS are the other main
distributor. Like Farnell they have a consumer site and business option
with the consumer option taking users to a dedicated Raspberry Pi store
while the business option takes them back to the regular RS site. They
do not state whether consumers must use the consumer site or not. The
order code for the Raspberry Pi is 756-8308. As of 2012-11-21, the
Raspberry Pi is listed as "Temporarily out of stock - back order for
despatch 21/12/2012".

RS has delayed existing orders on several occasions and are reported on
the forum as being very difficult to communicate with.

### Allied electronics

[http://www.alliedelec.com/](http://www.alliedelec.com/) Allied
electronics is the US sister company of RS. The order code for the
Raspberry Pi is 70229569. This page lists their current lineup of
Raspberry Pi and it's camera:
[https://www.alliedelec.com/images/products/mkt/pb/rasp/rasp.aspx](https://www.alliedelec.com/images/products/mkt/pb/rasp/rasp.aspx)

Reports from the forum are that Allied are easier to communicate with
than RS, but they do not appear to be being kept will informed of the
stock situation by RS.

## Egoman Technology Corp

[http://www.egoman.com.cn/](http://www.egoman.com.cn/) On 1st February
2013 the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced they had "granted Egoman
Technology Corp a licence to produce and distribute Pis in China and
Taiwan" and to differentiate these boards, they would only be produced
with red PCBs - [Red Pi at
night](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/3195). "Egoman are aiming to
make these Pis widely available in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan."

## Licensed Manufacture

The foundation has chosen to license manufacture of the Raspberry Pi,
which should provide several advantages including:

1.  The involvement of RS Components and Premier Farnell means that
    build volume can be increased much, much faster than would have been
    possible otherwise. Due to costs and working capital, the foundation
    would have been limited to batches of only 10k Raspberry Pi's; the
    Raspberry Pi will now be being built to match demand.
2.  Both Premier Farnell and RS Components have worldwide distribution
    networks, so wherever you are in the world, you will be able to buy
    from a local distributor. It’s a much better way for you to buy than
    getting them all shipped from the Foundation in the UK.
3.  Both RS Components and Premier Farnell will be taking preorders,
    something which the foundation would otherwise be unable to do.
4.  The foundation will still receive a percentage from the sale of
    every Raspberry Pi sold, which will be put straight back into the
    charity.
5.  Primarily, by removing the focus on dealing with manufacture,
    distribution and sales, this frees up the limited resources of the
    foundation to focus on the original aims and goals of the project.

Additional detail is available in the [video interview between Eben
Upton and SlashDot here
(2012-02-28)](http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/12/02/28/2347222/raspberry-pi-now-has-distributors----and-will-soon-have-boards-for-all-video).

Unfortunately the switch to licensed manufacture has also resulted in a
marked reduction in transparency of the process as Farnell and RS
consider detailed information of what is going on to be confidential.

## What You Get In The Box

1. Pre-Assembled Raspberry Pi board

2. A sheet containing a combination of regulatory information and some
very brief instructions.

*Note:*

*1. The board will be supplied assembled (since most of the components
are not suitable for home builds, including the
BGA<sup>[[2]](#cite_note-BGA-2)</sup>package mounted
SoC<sup>[[3]](#cite_note-SoC-3)</sup> and
PoP<sup>[[4]](#cite_note-PoP-4)</sup> memory).* *2. The board has the
GPIO header pins for the primary GPIO header (but not the secondary GPIO
header added on the revision 2 boards) populated. The SoC JTAG may or
may not be present depending on when the board was manufactured and at
which factory but aren't really of use to end users anyway due to the
lack of Broadcom documentation. The LAN JTAG header does not seem to be
present on any boards.* *3. All other connectors will be assembled in
place.*

## Accessories

To use the Raspberry Pi, a user will typically require some accessories.
All of the Raspberry Pi vendors listed above sell some accessories, but
the exact range varies. Accessories you should consider include.

-   USB Power Supply (UK/EU/US Compatible; 5V,
    700mA-1500mA(1.5A))<sup>[[5]](#cite_note-5)</sup>
-   SD card. Most distributors are selling pre-prepared SD cards which
    are usually 4 GB. Software is available to prepare your own SD
    cards.
-   There is a wide choice of [cases](http://eLinux.org/RPi_Cases "RPi Cases"), most
    distributors will have some but shopping around for one you like is
    suggested.
-   There are a variety of [AddOn/Expansion
    Boards](http://eLinux.org/Rpi_expansion_boards "Rpi expansion boards") now available,
    see that page for more details.

*See [Typical Hardware You Will
Need](http://eLinux.org/RPi_Hardware_Basic_Setup#Typical_Hardware_You_Will_Need "RPi Hardware Basic Setup")
for details about other items you may require.*

## Price

The price is \$35USD before shipping, duty, and tax, about \$60 after.

Although the foundation is UK based, the guide price of the units are in
USD since the Raspberry Pi components are sourced in USD\$.

The price is \$25USD (\~£16GBP) for model A, and \$35USD (\~£23GBP) for
model B.

Items will be subject to local tax (that is, UK will have 20% VAT added)
and shipping cost is not included.

See the following update on [RS Components and Farnell global
pricing](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/826) (2012-03-13).

## Clones & Copies

The foundation plans to release all the required
[schematics](http://eLinux.org/RPi_Hardware#Schematic_.2F_Layout "RPi Hardware") and
plans to reproduce the Raspberry Pi hardware, so clones and copies will
be welcome.

However, since the unit is built around the Broadcom SoC, the interested
party will require suitable sized orders to obtain them. The foundation
were fortunate enough to be supported in this aspect by Broadcom to
enable the project to be feasible.

## Historic information

1.  The foundation have built an initial run of 10,000 Model-B units.
2.  Due to extreme demand, the units were NOT sold directly from the
    [shop](http://www.raspberrypi.com) (see [\#Licensed
    Manufacture](#Licensed_Manufacture) below).
3.  You may buy a Raspberry Pi from
    [Farnell](http://www.element14.com/raspberrypi) or from [RS
    Components](http://rswww.com)
4.  A limit of one unit per person was applied for the first batch and
    some time afterwards

<!-- -->

    * There were reports that several people ordered multiple units at launch,
      however it appears that Farnell removed any excess items when they reviewed
      and confirmed the order for shipping dates.
      This has also appears to apply for the pre-orders they have taken.
      Many customers also ordered from both Farnell and RS.

### 1st Batch Order FAQ

Q - Couldn't this have been handled better, I couldn't get on the site to order and they sold too quickly?
Both distributors were indeed unprepared for the volume of traffic the
launch generated (they were warned by the foundation before hand).

Chances are if the foundation had gone with their original plan of
selling through their own shop, the situation would have been far worse,
with no option of pre-order either.

The distributors only have 5,000 units each to sell, reports have
estimated the registered interest/pre-orders totalling over 2 million
(no official figures available yet). Even if it is half of that, it
means the number of available units was less than 1% of the demand.

Q - If interest was obviously so high, why only build 10,000 units?
There is a big risk involved with building a large batch of units and
selling them, and 10,000 units would take well over \$250,000 in capital
investment. For a very small charity, that is a massive task in itself.
Much of that funding came from the Foundation Trustees' own personal
investment.

Thankfully, the massive bonus of licensing out manufacture, is that the
build rate is no longer limited by the foundation's own funding, which
means there will be many more units available much sooner.

Q - I've been unable to register an account with the distributor, as I am not a company?
There have been several reported problems with individuals placing
orders (that is, not having company accounts or details).

Both distributors "should" take orders from individuals. However, it
appears each of the different localised sites may have different
requirements so this will be investigated to ensure that this is
corrected if needed.

Often, many of the company related fields on application are optional.
If in doubt, contact their sales team for help.

Q - Worldwide launch? It was not available here!
The distributors decided to make the units only available from selected
locations. It appears the foundation were not made aware of this
beforehand.

Considering the small number of available units, it would have been
unlikely to have improved the situation.

Worldwide availability will be monitored, it is expected that they will
be made available as soon as possible.

Q - The price for the Raspberry Pi from Farnell versus the price from RS Components is different, why?
Please see the following page for details about [RS Components and
Farnell global pricing](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/826)
(2012-03-13).

Q - I've only been able to register my interest, what now?
Be patient, both distributors have said they will contact people when
they have more details (alternatively keep an eye on their sites for
news).

RS Components, in particular have only taken people's details, and
according to the above [press-release](#Press_Releases) will wait until
they receive their allocated 5,000 units.

Q - I registered on the Raspberry Pi Site's Mailing List, but I didn't get an email
Unfortunately, the mail server had problems with sending out the 100K+
emails in time, it is believed the email was often marked as spam by a
lot of email systems so was rejected or returned on-mass, or sent to
Junk folders. Yes, this system should have been tested, but the
foundation were keen not to send unnecessary emails to people prior to
launch.

The email contained the same information about the announcement as was
publicly posted on the website (2012-02-28) before launch day, no
additional or extra information was given through the email.
