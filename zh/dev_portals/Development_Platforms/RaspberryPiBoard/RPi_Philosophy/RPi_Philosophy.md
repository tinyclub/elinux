# Overview

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK registered charity (Registration
Number 1129409), based in Cambridge, which exists to promote the study
of computer science and related topics, especially at school level, and
to put the fun back into learning computing.

The Raspberry PI device is a single board computer designed to bring the
"Homebrew" back into electronics - getting away from the pre-packaged
products, which lack the spirit of technical adventure.

Children are naturally curious - but prising the back of your XBox or
IPad does not go down well! A Raspberry PI is cheap enough to break, and
powerful enough (we hope) to catch their imagination.

# The Ten Reasons

The Foundation (and educators in general<sup>[[1]](#cite_note-1)</sup>)
believe there are ten reasons why we aren't educating programmers:

1.  No examples/mentors/role models: "I don't know anyone who codes"
2.  Access: About 20% of UK people do not own a computer (source OFCOM
    2008) Those that do are often discouraged from experimenting. In
    other countries, or in the lower socio economic groups access is
    even more limited
3.  Expense: "Development systems cost hundreds of pounds, and are hard
    to use" Home PC systems are no longer supplied with programming
    tools
4.  Fear: "If I type the wrong thing I might break it" "We can’t let
    students write or run their own code on the schools system, as they
    might introduce a virus"
5.  Barriers to entrance: The learning curve to get started, for example
    to program in VB on a PC is quite steep. Some systems (for example
    Android) cannot be natively programmed. Others (for example games
    consoles) are locked down so only authorised companies can write
    software for them
6.  Culture: "Coding is only for propeller heads/boys/geeks" "Computer
    people are all like the IT crowd"
7.  Computing is “just more ICT” as presently taught in UK schools –
    boring, the equivilent of teaching children how to read but not how
    to write
8.  Lack of skills base in schools: "I know more about computers than my
    ICT teacher, who usually teaches PE and RI" "I don’t know where to
    start and my teacher can’t help"
9.  Perceived difficulty: "I can't write anything significant on my own
    - it takes a big team"
10. Perceived career prospects: "Coding leads to low paid jobs" "Coding
    jobs are all offshore" "The school points system/University entrance
    doesn’t value Computing" "the dot-com bubble has burst"

These are roughly in the inverse order to the [ACCTO
criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_change#Innovation)
(Advantage, Complexity, Compatibility, Trialability, Observability)
criteria of Everett Rogers given in his book "Diffusion of
Innovation"<sup>[[2]](#cite_note-2)</sup>.

The Raspberry Pi Device solves exactly one of those problems: that
computers are too expensive. By driving the price down to the point
where devices and associated software can be purchased with a few weeks'
pocket money - and making devices easy to recover or reset to their
default state - it should be possible to mitigate reasons 2, 3 and 4
above. The Foundation believes that they may eventually be able to do
something about the first 5<sup>[[3]](#cite_note-3)</sup>.

# Landmarks and tenets

-   It should be possible to equip a class with Raspberry Pis for no
    more than the average annual spend on subject (say, chemistry)
    textbooks for an equivilent sized class [1]
-   Use of educational computers should not be fenced into 1 or 2 hours
    a week of 'formal curriculum time'
-   Devices (should) belong to the student, not the school
-   If it costs money, it doesn't get added to the hardware design
-   A thing that you can plug into things you already own; A peripheral
    for your TV
-   Follow the tail of the [Moore's
    Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#The_tip_and_tail_of_the_curve)
    curve down (ie basic computing getting cheaper over time) rather
    than following the tip of the curve up (over time computers becoming
    more powerful, with more features, while maintaining their price
    point relative to inflation).

[1] Eben originally said that Raspberry Pi devices should cost no more
than what he thought a school textbook costs. It turns out that it has
been some time since Eben purchased a school textbook! A school textbook
typically costs \$75-125 and has an average lifespan of three to five
years before needing to be replaced due to wear or curriculum changes,
although some schools keep some course textbooks for much longer.

# Success

What does success look like?

Eben's personal view: Another 1000 Engineers a year entering the UK ICT
Industry
