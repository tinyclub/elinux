## Legal Issues using Linux in embedded projects

The intricacies of using the GPL license have been hashed out repeatedly
in many other forums.

Here are some highlights of a few specific issues that come up
occasionaly:

### Kernel is licensed GPL v2 only

The Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License,
version 2.0 **ONLY!**

This is different from many other projects, which use the default
wording in the license to allow GPL v2 or any later version.

This means it is unlikely that the kernel will switch to GPL version
3.0.

In September of 2006, a group of Linux kernel developers signed a
[position statement](http://lwn.net/Articles/200422/) indicating that
they objected to GPL version 3.0 (as then drafted). This further
indicates the unlikelyhood of any change of the kernel to the GPL v3
license.

### Signed-off-by lines and the DCO

When developers contribute to the kernel, they must provide a
"Signed-off-by" line, indicating that they acknowledge the licensing and
declare the work (to the best of their knowledge) to be either original,
or derivative of something compatible with GPL v2.

See the [Developer Certificate Of
Origin](../.././dev_portals/Legal_Issues/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin.md "Developer Certificate Of Origin")
which is contained in the kernel's
[Documentation/SubmittingPatches](http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
file.

### Resources for legal analysis and compliance

-   The Software Freedom Law Center has a compliance guide for GPL that
    is useful:

    -   Note that not everyone agrees with all legal interpretations
        included in this document, but overall it's a good resource.

## EXPORT\_SYMBOL\_GPL

### EXPORT\_SYMBOL\_GPL for kernel USB API

In January of 2008, Greg Kroah Hartman submitted a patch to change the
core USB API to EXPORT\_SYMBOL\_GPL. Here is some information about that
change:

## Binary proprietary kernel modules

One outstanding legal question with Linux, that is of particular
importance in embedded, is whether or not binary (non-GPL) kernel
modules violate the GPL license of the Linux kernel.

Opinions on this topic differ.

Here is an article with some interesting information:

    software](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/120606-closed-modules1.html)

    interface](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/120806-closed-modules2.html)

    tax"](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/121106-closed-modules3.html)

## Use of kernel header files in user-space

It is allowed to use kernel header files in user space, in order for
user-space programs to interact with the kernel via ordinary system
calls. This is allowed without the result that the user-space program
becomes a derivative work of the kernel and therefore subject to GPL.

In general, use of header files do not create derivative works, although
there can be exceptions. There used to be a lot of attention paid to the
amount of code (e.g. number of lines) included from a header file, but
no one seems to care about that these days, and this is almost never a
problem. Richard Stallman has stated that use of header files for data
structures, constant definitions, and enumerations (and even small
inlines) does not create a derivative work. See:
[http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0301.1/0362.html](http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0301.1/0362.html)

The user-space use of the kernel header files is expected and ordinary.
This explicitly encompasses non-GPL software using these files, and not
being affected by the GPL. In order to calm fears about using the header
files directly, and to prevent leakage of kernel internal information to
user-space (where it might be abused), the mainline kernel developers
added an option to the kernel build system to specifically create
"sanitized" headers that are deemed safe for use by user-space programs,
without incurring licensing issues.

These are the "make headers\_check" and "make headers\_install" targets
in the kernel build system.

In general, it is legally safest to use such sanitized headers (that is,
headers that have specifically been stripped of large inline macros or
anything not required for user space.)

This article explains how to create sanitized kernel headers using the
kernel build system.
[http://darmawan-salihun.blogspot.jp/2008/03/sanitizing-linux-kernel-headers-strange.html](http://darmawan-salihun.blogspot.jp/2008/03/sanitizing-linux-kernel-headers-strange.html)

Note that a different process was used by the developers of the Android
operating system, to sanitize headers for bionic for their system. Their
process was developed around the same time as the mainline header
sanitization feature.
