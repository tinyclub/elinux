## Andre Kruetzfeldt

## Armin Gerritsen

Armin Gerritsen is a young and enthusiastic embedded software developer.
He started as a physicist, but entered Philips shortly after receiving
his master degree on the area of computational physics, where he was
hired to do modelling for future generations of Philips Semiconductor
platforms. Shortly after he was sucked into the embedded Linux world and
failed to escape since then. His job is to support the implementation of
new designs by writing software necessary for (dis)proving new concepts,
prototypes and demonstrator platforms. The vast majority of this
software is based on Linux.

## Chang-Sik Cho

sysfs, kobject, kref, and debugfs code. He is also the maintainer of the
linux-hotplug and udev projects. On top of that he maintains the Gentoo
Linux packages for these programs, and helps with the kernel package,
which put him in touch with actual users every day, thereby ensuring his
email inbox is never empty. He is also the co-author of the book, "Linux
Device Drivers, 3rd Edition" and a contributing editor for Linux
Journal.

## Greg Ungerer

Greg specializes in embedded systems development, having spent more than
15 years developing embedded software, and more than 10 years developing
with Linux.

Greg is currently one of the core maintainers of the uClinux project. He
first started hacking on it 7 years ago, and did the port to the
Motorola Cold Fire CPU family. Over the last couple of years Greg has
been pushing the uClinux support into Linus's mainline 2.6 series Linux
kernels. Greg has been involved in the design and release of many
commercial products based on uClinux software over the last few years.

8-bit microprocessors to Silicon Graphics workstations. He was writing
applications for Linux at the time when it was still called Unix, AIX,
Irix or Solaris. Instead of writing software he now spends most of his
time porting existing open-source applications to the Philips
Semiconductor's Nexperia platform and talking about it.
