# OpenGL



OpenGL is the premier environment for developing portable, interactive
2D and 3D graphics applications. Since its introduction in 1992, OpenGL
has become the industry's most widely used and supported 2D and 3D
graphics application programming interface (API), bringing thousands of
applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. OpenGL fosters
innovation and speeds application development by incorporating a broad
set of rendering, texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful
visualization functions. Developers can leverage the power of OpenGL
across all popular desktop and workstation platforms, ensuring wide
application deployment.
