# Linux PM Summit 2006 Planning



Here is information about the Spring 2006 Linux Power Management Summit.

if CELF could become a sponsor of this.

This page has some information about the possible location, date, time,
attendees, sponsors and other plans for this event.

[need to add other invitees here. Are all relevant segments represented?
silicon vendors, laptop, virtualization, CE]

In addition, Patrick would like to reserve two more spots for
developers. These will be selected by him (with collaboration from those
listed above), and will have a strong community presence. Patrick will
decide on these people in the next three months.

### Other invitation/attendee guidelines

Patrick wants 1 (and only 1) developer representative from each, which
he will select based on community presence and my knowledge of the
organizations. I may require input from some poeple within the
organization. This selection will be made within the next three months.
More organizations may arise as well.

For sponsors, Patrick would like at most 1 (and only 1) additional
representative, on top of the developer representative. I do not want
more than 2 people from any one company, with the temporary exception of
Novell which has emerged as a leader in power management development.

As we approach the date, we would like the name(s) of the
representatives from each organization. I will not allow guests to
attend, and I am very hestitant about having substitutions.

Patrick said:

    I do not intend to sound harsh, but I am very concerned about keeping it
    as small and as focused as possible. I want everyone in attendence to
    participate in some form or another, and I want every face to be known by
    the end of the three days. This becomes harder as the size of the group
    increases, hence my strictness.



## Meeting Details

-   Date: Preference was earlier stated as Jan/Feb.
-   Time:
-   Location: San Jose??
    -   Directions:

-   meals:
-   gifts?

## Agenda

The proposal is for a 3-day event: (Wednesday - Friday)

### Day 1: Developer Workshops

       This is an opportunity for us to discuss current events and
       progress since the last time we met (in July) and resolve any
       outstanding issues.

       I expect each person to have 1 hour to lead a discussion
       about a topic of their choice, the more technical the better. I
       expect each person to:

       - Have a presentation or prepared introduction
       - Have a desired outcome, or at least a direction in which they
         want to lead the talk
       - Keep the discussion to exactly one hour

       This will be finalized more as the time nears.

       I expect this to be a private engagement among the developers so
       that we can maximize the efficiency of the time. However, I expect
       there to be developers from each distribution and vendor there, so
       perhaps the developers from each distro and vendor could sit in as
       well.

### Day 2: Sponsor / Vendor Presentations

       I anticipate this will be split into two halves: one half for
       sponsors to present a topic that they feel is a pressing issue,
       whether it is a hardware or software feature. I would like this to
       be limited to current topics. The number of presentations will
       depend on the number of sponsors, but I don't expect more than 5.
       I would like to limit these presentations / discussions to 90
       minutes. I would also like these to be very technical and given by
       someone that is familiar with the technical topics.

       The 2nd half would be reserved for upcoming / emerging technology
       presentations. This would be an opportunity for vendors to display
       future concepts that will have an impact on power management
       infrastructure (e.g. new processor features) or will use the power
       management infrastructure (e.g. new devices). This will be
       dependent also on the number of vendors present, but I don't
       expect there to be more than 5. I would like these to also be very
       technical and to be limited to 30-45 minutes.



### Day 3: Developer Discussions

       This is an opportunity for the developers to discuss the topics
       presented in the previous day (and to determine the best way to
       resolve the issues). This will also be an opportunity for them to
       discuss any remaining issues and to evolve any topics that arose
       over the previous two days.

       I anticipate the format of this to be 60-90 minute Birds of a
       Feather-like sessions, the topics of which are to be determined by
       the attendees and the topics of the previous presentations.

       I expect there to be a closing session and/or reception dinner.

## Sponsors

-   CE Linux Forum
-   [others?]

### Sponsor Benefits

In order to make sponsorship attractive, the following benefits are
available to sponsors of the event:

-   ability to provide a handout or gift at the summit
-   signage at the summit (a reasonably-sized sign will be allowed from
    each sponsor)
-   listing of sponsor on all public materials referencing the summit
    (including web site, announcements, etc.)
-   mention of sponsor at the summit
-   sponsors may disclose and promote their sponsorship of the event
-   a sponsor will have the opportunity to send a developer to the event
    -   This is highly desired. The vendors and sponsors should come
        prepared to talk about their issues.

## Past Summits
