### TIPS

-   [Yokohama Area Guide](http://www.welcome.city.yokohama.jp/tourism/)
    -   (English, Korean and Chinese pages available)
-   [http://www.interconti.co.jp/yokohama/access/](http://www.interconti.co.jp/yokohama/access/)
    -   Hotel home page (Japanese with some English)
-   Conversation guide with the taxi drivers
    -   Unfortunately, most of taxi drivers in Japan only speak
        Japanese :( . Followings are instruction message to the taxi
        driver when you go to the hotel, for your convenience:
        -   **(Japanese) :
            横浜グランドインターコンチネンタルホテルまでお願いします。**
            -   Print it out and present to the driver.
            -   *Pronounciation: [ Destination ] ma-de onegai shimasu.*
        -   (Take me to the Yokohama Grand Intercontinental Hotel)
-   Train service
    -   Train services in Japan are safe and punctual. To our regret we
        had a serious accident recently in Osaka area, however we do
        believe you may feel the journey on train at ease.
    -   Bus services may delay due to the famous traffic jam in Tokyo
        area, however for the bus services between Narita and Yokohama,
        the drivers try to escape from the crowded route, so that the
        delay may be within 20 minutes.
    -   How to buy train ticket from the automatic ticketing machine.
        1.  Ensure the price (you may find the map with tarif in Englist
            at each station)
        2.  Prepare 1000Yen note, 500Yen coin, 100Yen coin, 50Yen coin
            or 10Yen coin. Except those note or coins, the machine does
            not accept.
        3.  Insert the coins or note and press the touch pannel which
            shows your tariff amount.
        4.  Changes are given.
    -   Pre-paid cards are also available but please be noted that the
        card for JR line and the other lines (mostly private railway
        line or municipal line) are different. (In 2006, it is scheduled
        to be consolidated. The card for private or municipal lines are
        already consolidated which is named *pass-net*).
