## Introduction

The CE Linux Forum is hosting the second Open Source DLNA Summit, in Ede
Netherlands, November 8 2008.


 This summit is co-located at the same venue as [Embedded Linux
Conference
Europe](http://www.embeddedlinuxconference.com/elc_europe08/index.html).

    (Note that registration in Embedded Linux Conference is not required for attending the DLNA Summit)

Presentation](http://github.com/zeenix/gupnp-presentation-2008/zipball/os-dlna-conf)

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this conference is to facilitate the meeting and
sharing of information among several parties interested in open source
implementations of the DLNA specifications. These includes open source
developers, product developers who might use these implementations,
representatives from the DLNA organization or from related companies
(certification and testing labs), and from members of the CE Linux Forum
who are interested in this work.

We shall also be conducting a DLNA plug-fest during this summit.
Particpants interested in the plugfest are invited to bring their DLNA
devices to test for interoperability with other devices.

This page has information about the summit. It will be updated as more
information becomes available.

The CE Linux Forum is interested in promoting and supporting work in
this area, for eventual use in Linux-based CE products. It is hoped that
by collaborating we can avoid duplication of effort, strengthen
interoperability between implementations, and help accelerate the
development of robust and feature-full solutions. During this summit we
also want to gauge the interest level for holding such events in the
future and discuss ideas for making them more productive.
