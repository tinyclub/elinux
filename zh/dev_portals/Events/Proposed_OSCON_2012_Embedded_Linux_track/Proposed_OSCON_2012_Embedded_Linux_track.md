# Proposed OSCON 2012 Embedded Linux track



OSCON 2011 had a limited amount of content about Linux, embedded
development, BSD and relevant tools, notably in the [Open
Hardware](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/proceedings#topic-661)
track. Let's propose a lot more talks and sessions in 2012. The purpose
of this page is to gather suggestions for what embedded Linux content
OSCON 2012 should include.

## Motivation: Why the Embedded Community Might Care about OSCON

OSCON is a giant meeting of a diverse group of influential open source
developers, leaders, and businesspeople. By speaking to contributors to
other projects outside our traditional contacts in the embedded world,
eLinux engineers can recruit talented people who are not currently
working on embedded and can promote the spread of Linux into new
applications. For example, OSCON attracts Python developers who might
attend one presentation about build and configuration management in the
embedded space but who never attend ELC. OSCON attendees who work on
server-based virtualization might be curious to learn more about device
emulators or mobile security. UI/UX designers in Portland might chat in
the hallway with compiler deployers who are stuck with creating a new
GUI . . .
