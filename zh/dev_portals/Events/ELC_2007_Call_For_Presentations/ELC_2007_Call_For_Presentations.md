## Presentations Page

-   All presentations can now be found on
    [ELC\_2007\_Presentations](../../.././dev_portals/Events/ELC_2007_Presentations/ELC_2007_Presentations.md "ELC 2007 Presentations").

## Guidelines

Presentations should be of a technical nature, covering topics related
to use of Linux in embedded systems. The CE Linux Forum is focused on
the use of Linux in consumer electronics products, but presentations may
cover use of Linux in other embedded areas, as long as the topic is of
general relevance to most embedded users.

Presentations that are commercial advertisements or sales pitches are
not appropriate for this conference.

Presentations on the following topics are encouraged:

-   Audio, Video, and Graphics systems for embedded products
-   Security
-   System size
-   Bootup time
-   Meeting real-time constraints
-   Power management
-   Streaming media
-   Flash memory devices and filesystems
-   Technologies related to cell phones, digital settop boxes, handheld
    devices, or other CE products
-   Development tools for embedded users
-   Use of Linux in actual products, practical experience and war
    stories
-   Standards for CE products

Most presentation slots are 50 minutes long, including time for
questions. A few shorter 40-minute slots are also available.

A paper submission is NOT required in conjunction with the presentation.
However, if a paper is produced, it is requested to be published in wiki
format on the Embedded Linux Wiki.

You may also submit a request to present a tutorial. Tutorials are
intended to be longer, interactive learning sessions. A tutorial may
occupy more than one session slot at the conference.

We prefer presentations that have not been previously presented, but
exceptions will be made for material that is either of great interest or
has been seen previously only by a limited audience.

A single person may submit more than one proposal. However, since the
number of slots is limited, it is likely that at most one proposal from
an individual will be accepted.

For examples of presentations from previous years' conferences, see:
[Tech Conference
2005Docs](../../.././dev_portals/Security/Tech_Conference_2005Docs/Tech_Conference_2005Docs.md "Tech Conference 2005Docs") and [ELC
2006 Presentations](../../.././dev_portals/Events/ELC_2006_Presentations/ELC_2006_Presentations.md "ELC 2006 Presentations")

## Technical Facilities

Presentations will be in rooms with 1024ï¿½768 XGA data projectors. Please
bring your own laptop for your presentation. Please contact us if you
have further requirements.

## Reward and possible assistance

Speakers will receive complimentary professional registration for the
conference. That is, if you make a presentation, you get into the rest
of the conference for free

Travel and accomodation assistance is available for a limited number of
speakers, under certain circumstances. Please contact the e-mail address
below if you believe your circumstances would qualify you for this
assistance.

## Review

All presentation, tutorial, demo and BOF proposals will be reviewed by
the CE Linux Forum, and submitters will be notified of their acceptance
(or not) by March 1, 2007.

Proposals will be assessed on a number of criteria:

-   Is the topic of interest to embedded Linux developers? That is, is
    it relevant for using Linux in embedded products?
-   Does the presentation describe something new or interesting?
-   Does the topic fit with other presentations planned for the
    conference?
-   Is source code for the project (if applicable) available now?
-   May the forum publish your presentation on it's web site?

## Submission method

To submit a presentation proposal, send an e-mail to
[celf-elc@tree.celinuxforum.org](mailto:celf-elc@tree.celinuxforum.org)

A presentation request should include your name, a presentation title
and a brief (one or two paragraph) abstract. Also, please indicate with
your proposal whether your presentation may be published by the forum on
it's web site, after the conference.

If your proposal is accepted, you will be requested to provide a short
paragraph describing yourself, for use in conference materials.

If you have questions, you may also send queries to the e-mail address
above. We will be happy to answer questions about the presentation
requirements or the conference itself.



## Deadlines

Proposals for presentations, demos and Birds-of-a-Feather sessions must
be received by February 5, 2007.

Speakers will be notified by March 1, 2007.
