# Overcoming Obstacles to Mainlining



Information about overcoming obstacles to mainlining.

Tim Bird gave a presentation about overcoming obstacles to mainlining,
at ELC Europe 2014 in Düsseldorf, Germany.

Here are the slides for the talk:

Please note that a few cosmetic errors were fixed, as well as 2 pages
were added at the end with notes or suggestions from people I talked to
at the event.

## Abstract

Here is the abstract for the talk:

Many companies struggle with contributing to Open Source projects. This
talk will identify key difficulties that many large companies face in
making contributions, and provide tips and lessons learned for
overcoming these obstacles. Some of the difficulties discussed will be:
version gap, expertise problems (an example of which is the "proxy
problem"), wrongly-abstracted code, process mismatch, and social and
attitudinal barriers. This will not be yet another talk on CodingStyle,
but a more high-level look at structural problems inside companies and
the industry that prevent meaningful engagement within the open source
community.

The goal of this talk is to help individual developers and companies
identify and implement practices that will accelerate their
participation in open source, so that they can enjoy more of the value
of open source besides just the open code base.

## Outline

-   Intro
    -   Anna Karenina Principle
        -   "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is
            unhappy in its own way"
        -   There are lots of ways to fail, but only a few ways to
            succeed

    (replace step 2 with "overcome obstacles"

-   Obstacles
    -   no recognition of upstream at all
        -   waterfall and squirtgun metaphor
    -   Version Gap
        -   You can't actually help if you're working on the wrong thing
        -   The kernel changes more quickly than you think
    -   Expertise problems
    -   Quick Hacks
        -   It takes longer to write good code
        -   Good code might not be better for you!
    -   Bad abstractions
    -   Process mismatch
        -   Not using git - you're doomed
        -   SubmittingPatches - death by a thousand cuts
    -   Social barriers
        -   misunderstanding the currency - see "And then there were
            none"
        -   fear of failure
    -   Lack of support
        -   Middle managers don't get it, Execs won't prioritize it.
-   Survey results
-   Overcoming them
-   Words from the sages
-   Summary of Best Practices
