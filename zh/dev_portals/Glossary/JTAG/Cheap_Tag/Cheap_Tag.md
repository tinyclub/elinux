# Cheap Tag



**NOTE: This page describes what the Cheap Tag is, but the link to the
original information is broken.**

Cheaptag is the equivalent of a Xilinx Parallel Jtag programming cable
which you can make up from bits and pieces of dead ISA cards and old
wires that are lying around. It is intended to cost nothing at all, even
if you bought all the parts it would be a couple of dollars.

-   Powered by the Jtag device it is plugged into
-   Suitable for 5V-tolerant designs only (eg, 9500, 9500XL)
-   The Xilinx software accepts it as a Xilinx Parallel cable without
    any configuration being necessary
-   Cheap, unbuffered design means it will not work with some poorly
    designed printer ports, but will work with 99% of the ports out
    there.
