# Heap memory



Heap is the memory allocated in runtime during program execution. When
memory is allocated using malloc() or calloc() for any pointer in a
program, the size of the memory is allocated from the heap memory area
and is assigned to the pointer. Until the pointer is freed using free()
the heap memory is used by the pointer variable.

See [Memory Debuggers](http://eLinux.org/Memory_Debuggers "Memory Debuggers") for tools
that help analyze memory usage patterns, detect unbalanced allocations
and frees, report buffer over- and under-runs, etc.
