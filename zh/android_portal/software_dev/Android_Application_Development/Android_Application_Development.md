# Android Application Development

# 安卓应用开发


For the most reliable reference to the Android Application Development
go through:

安卓应用最可靠的开发资源，请参考：

## [http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html](http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html)

This includes java doc to all classes, packages, and other variables and
is the most updated site.

这个是最新的网页，它包含了JAVA 文档包含了所有的类、包以及其他变量

Though it is most customary to get started in Eclipse, which is the most
standard, you are also free to use Netbeans, but the Netbeans updates
for the Android SDK plugin is not very dynamic and to my knowledge was
developed and supported by a single project called Kenai.

You should also know that you can not step into Android Application
Development with out having base on Core Java programming, yes, that is
a pre-requisite, else it is bit difficult.

So then, welcome, get ready to jump into the droid community and get
going.
