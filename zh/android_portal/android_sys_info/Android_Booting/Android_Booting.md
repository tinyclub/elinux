## Key bootup components

### Bootloader

The first program which runs on any Android system is the bootloader.
Technically, the bootloader is outside the realm of Android itself, and
is used to do very low-level system initialization, before loading the
Linux kernel. The kernel then does the bulk of hardware, driver and file
system initialization, before starting up the user-space programs and
applications that make up Android.

Often, the first-stage bootloader will provide support for loading
recovery images to the system flash, or performing other recovery,
update, or debugging tasks.

The bootloader on the ADP1 detects certain keypresses, which can be used
to make it load a 'recovery' image (second instance of the kernel and
system), or put the phone into a mode where the developer can perform
development tasks ('fastboot' mode), such as re-writing flash images,
directly downloading and executing an alternate kernel image, etc.

### 'init'

A key component of the Android bootup sequence is the program 'init',
which is a specialized program for initializing elements of the Android
system. Unlike other Linux systems (embedded or otherwise), Android uses
its own initialization program. (Linux desktop systems have historically
used some combination of /etc/inittab and sysV init levels - e.g.
/etc/rc.d/init.d with symlinks in /etc/rc.d/rc.[2345]). Some embedded
Linux systems use simplified forms of these -- such as the init program
included in busybox, which processes a limited form of /etc/inittab, or
a direct invocation of a shell script or small program to do fixed
initialization steps.

The Android 'init' program processes two files, executing the commands
it finds in them, called 'init.rc' and 'init.\<machine\_name\>.rc',
where \<machine\_name\> is the name of the hardware that Android is
running on. (Usually, this is a code word. The name of the HTC1 hardware
for the ADP1 is 'trout', and the name of the emulator is 'goldfish'.

The 'init.rc' file is intended to provide the generic initialization
instructions, while the 'init.\<machine\_name\>.rc' file is intended to
provide the machine-specific initialization instructions.

#### 'init' resources

The syntax for these .rc files is documented in a readme file in the
source tree. See the [Android init language
reference](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/init/readme.txt)

Or, see also: [kandroid copy of old Android
PDK](http://www.kandroid.org/online-pdk/guide/bring_up.html)

-   Note that the old PDK has been retracted from where it used to found
    below
    [http://source.android.com/porting](http://source.android.com/porting)
    -   You may be able to reconstruct it though:
        -   You need a local copy of the AOSP sourcetree, and run the
            usual *build/envsetup.sh* preparation
        -   Use *repo init -b* to check out the AOSP sourcetree with a
            tag around 2.3, then *make sdk sdk\_all*
        -   This worked for me, though I used some tag around 4.0.4.
            Some links had to be fixed in the resulting html output

## Sequence of boot steps on ADP1

### firmware

-   first-stage bootloader runs
    -   it detects if a special key is held, and can launch the recovery
        image, or the 'fastboot' bootloader
-   eventually, a kernel is loaded into RAM (usually with an initrd)
    -   normally, this will be the kernel from the 'boot' flash
        partition.

### kernel

-   the kernel boots
    -   core kernel initialization
        -   memory and I/O areas are initialized
        -   interrupts are started, and the process table is initialized
    -   driver initialization
    -   kernel daemons (threads) are started
    -   root file system is mounted
    -   the first user-space process is started
        -   usually /init (note that other Linux systems usually start
            /sbin/init)

### user space

-   the kernel runs /init
    -   /init processes /init.rc and /init.\<machine\_name\>.rc
    -   dalvik VM is started (zygote). See [Android Zygote
        Startup](http://eLinux.org/Android_Zygote_Startup "Android Zygote Startup")
    -   several daemons are started:
        -   rild - radio interface link daemon
        -   vold - volume daemon (media volumes, as in file systems -
            nothing to do with audio volume)
-   the system\_server starts, and initializes several core services
    -   See
        [http://www.androidenea.com/2009/07/system-server-in-android.html](http://www.androidenea.com/2009/07/system-server-in-android.html)
    -   initalization is done in 2 steps:
        -   1) a library is loaded to initialize interfaces to native
            services, then
        -   2) java-based core services are initialized in
            ServerThread::run() in
            [SystemServer.java](http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/frameworks/base.git;a=blob;f=services/java/com/android/server/SystemServer.java)
-   the activity manager starts core applications (which are themselves
    dalvik applications)
    -   com.android.phone - phone application
    -   android.process.acore - home (desktop) and a few core apps.
-   other processes are also started by /init, somewhere in there:
    -   adb
    -   mediaserver
    -   dbus-daemon
    -   akmd

## Tools for analyzing Android Bootup

-   logcat - see [Android Logging
    System](../../../android_portal/android_sys_info/Android_Logging_System/Android_Logging_System.md "Android Logging System")
    -   try this command: 'adb logcat -d -b events | grep "boot"

-   Bootchart - see [Using Bootchart on
    Android](http://eLinux.org/Using_Bootchart_on_Android "Using Bootchart on Android")
-   strace is pretty handy also, to see the timings for system calls
    from a process as it runs
    -   You can use strace as a wrapper for a program in init.rc, and
        save the results to a file
    -   Use -f to follow sub-processes
    -   Use -tt to get detailed timestamps for syscalls
    -   Use -o to output the data to a file

Here is an example of using strace to follow the startup of zygote, and
the apps that are forked from it.

Replace:

    service zygote /system/bin/app_process -Xzygote /system/bin --zygote --start-system-server

with

    service zygote /system/xbin/strace -f -tt -o /cache/debug/boot.strace /system/bin/app_process -Xzygote /system/bin --zygote --start-system-server

Here is some sample data:

    $ head boot.strace
    571   00:00:11.389939 execve("/system/bin/app_process", ["/system/bin/app_process", "-Xzygote", "/system/bin", "--zygote", "--start-system-server"], [/* 15 vars */]) = 0
    571   00:00:11.658878 brk(0)            = 0x804b000
    571   00:00:11.659048 mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x77f9a000
    571   00:00:11.659169 readlink("/proc/self/exe", "/system/bin/app_process", 4096) = 23
    571   00:00:11.659339 access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK) = 0
    571   00:00:11.659440 open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY) = 3
    571   00:00:11.659548 fstat64(0x3, 0x7fa76650) = 0
    571   00:00:11.659887 mmap2(NULL, 36, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x77f99000
    571   00:00:11.659970 close(3)          = 0
    571   00:00:11.660071 open("/lib/libc_sse.so", O_RDONLY) = 3

Please note that writing the strace data takes extra time. For long
sequences of very fast syscalls (such as when the timezone file is being
read) the overhead of strace itself exaggerates the timings in the
trace. Use the timing information with caution.

### 1-second boot of Android

Ubiquitous Corporation has announced boot of ARM-based Android system in
1 second. Actually, it's more like a suspend and resume than a boot. See
