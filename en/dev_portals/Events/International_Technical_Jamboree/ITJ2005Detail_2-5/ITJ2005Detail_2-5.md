## Special Session: "Ottawa Linux Symposium and CE Linux Forum"

### by Tim Bird (Architecture Group Chair)

### Description

In this session, I will describe CELF's planned participation in the
Ottawa Linux Symposium (OLS). OLS is one of the most important technical
events of the year in the Linux kernel community. CELF is one of the
sponsors of this event annually, and we will be there again this year.

In this presentation, I will give advice and tips for those planning on
attending the event. Also, if you cannot attend the event personally, I
will tell you how to benefit from this great Linux conference.

Finally, I will make a plea for increased participation in the open
source community, prior to OLS, to help raise the visibility of CE
issues at the conference.
