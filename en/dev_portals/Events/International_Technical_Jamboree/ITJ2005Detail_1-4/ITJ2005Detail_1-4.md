## (OMAP OSK)

### by Steve Johnson(Matsushita/Panasonic)

### Description

-   The OMAP5912 Starter Kit (OSK) is an inexpensive development board
    that is relatively easy to set up and use. Recently, I've been
    trying to use the [Open Embedded](http://eLinux.org/Open_Embedded "Open Embedded")
    tools to get a complete system running on the OSK. This presentation
    will cover the trials and tribulations involved with using a
    complete set of tools that is rapidly evolving which also wants
    things done in its own particular way, from the initial set up of
    [Open Embedded](http://eLinux.org/Open_Embedded "Open Embedded"), through configuring
    (or reconfiguring) the kernel, and finally to booting and testing
    the implementation.
