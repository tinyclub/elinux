# DLNA Hardware Sharing List



Here is a list of hardware that might be interesting for DLNA
development and test work.

## Contents

-   [1 Available Hardware](#available-hardware)

## Available Hardware

This is a list of hardware that is known, and available for DLNA
development work. If you have something that you would be willing to
share, or could run tests on for people, please add it to the list. The
idea is that we keep a sort of "virtual hardware library", where items
can be checked out (being sent between developers as needed). This list
keeps track of who has such hardware, and whether it can currently be
borrowed or not.

 Status can be:

-   In use
-   Can be borrowed
-   Working
-   Broken

## Desired Hardware

-   Sergey wants a PS3 - European model
-   Ben wants a European PS3
-   Anyone want a Nokia N800??

### Notes

Sergey wrote: As far as I know the Telegent TG100 device is based on the
CyberTan MA100 implementation, and we had to add two hacks to work
around bugs in the TG100 firmware. So I really wonder how it got the
DLNA certification when the UPnP part is already causing trouble.

By the way, the TG100 can be bought for around 70EUR on E-Bay, which is
quite cheap. The question is, if it still qualifies since it's an MA100
spin-off.

I can probably get my hands on the BridgeCo WAA device, audio only is
somewhat limited but still better than nothing for the start.
