## Guidelines

Presentations should be of a technical nature, covering topics related
to use of Linux in embedded systems. The CE Linux Forum is focused on
the use of Linux in consumer electronics products, but presentations may
cover use of Linux in other embedded areas, as long as the topic is of
general relevance to most embedded users.

Presentations that are commercial advertisements or sales pitches are
not appropriate for this conference.

Presentations on the following topics are encouraged:

-   Audio, Video, and Graphics systems for embedded products
-   Security
-   System size
-   Bootup time
-   Meeting real-time constraints
-   Power management
-   Streaming media
-   Flash memory devices and filesystems
-   Build systems
-   Embedded distributions
-   Development tools for embedded users
-   Technologies related to cell phones, digital settop boxes,
    televisions, cameras, handheld devices, or other CE products
-   Use of Linux in actual products, practical experience and war
    stories
-   Standards for CE products

Most presentation slots are 50 minutes long, including time for
questions.

### No paper required

A paper submission is NOT required in conjunction with the presentation.
However, if a paper is produced, it is requested to be published in wiki
format on the [Embedded Linux Wiki](http://elinux.org/)

### Tutorials

You may also submit a request to present a tutorial. Tutorials are
intended to be longer, interactive learning sessions. A tutorial may
occupy more than one session slot at the conference.

### Birds of a Feather (BOF) sessions

You may also submit a request to be the session leader for a "Birds Of A
Feather" (BOF) session. This is an informal discussion on a topic of
group interest. For a BOF proposal, please describe the topic area you
would like to discuss. You should come prepared to help move the
discussion along with a "lead in" presentation (a few slides) or some
thought-provoking questions.

### Technical Showcase (Demo)

Finally there will be a "poster" demo session at the event. The demo
session consists of table-top demos, with an accompanying poster
describing each demo. In this session, the demonstrator can interact
with individuals or small groups, describe their work and answer
questions.

### General Guidelines

We prefer presentations that have not been previously presented, but
exceptions will be made for material that is either of great interest or
has been seen previously only by a limited audience.

A single person may submit more than one proposal. However, since the
number of slots is limited, it is likely that at most one proposal from
an individual will be accepted.

## Technical Facilities

Presentations will be in rooms with 1024Ã—768 XGA data projectors. Please
bring your own laptop for your presentation. Please contact us if you
have further requirements.

## Reward and possible assistance

Speakers for presentation and tutorial sessions, as well as leaders of
BoF sessions, will receive complimentary professional registration for
the conference. That is, if you make a presentation or lead a session,
you get into the rest of the conference for free! Please note, that if a
session has multiple speakers, only the primary speaker for that session
will receive free admission.

Please note that event admission includes access to the Linux Foundation
Collaboration Summit, which is normally an invitation-only event.

Travel and accomodation assistance is available for a limited number of
speakers, under certain circumstances. Please contact the e-mail address
below if you believe your circumstances would qualify you for this
assistance.

## Review Process

All presentation, tutorial, demo and BOF proposals will be reviewed by
the ELC program committee, and submitters will be notified of their
acceptance (or not) by February 5, 2010.

Proposals will be assessed on a number of criteria:

-   Is the topic of interest to embedded Linux developers?
    -   That is, is it relevant for using Linux in embedded products?
-   Does the presentation describe something new or interesting?
-   Does the topic fit with other presentations planned for the
    conference?
-   Is source code for the project (if applicable) available now?
-   May the forum publish your presentation on it's web site?



## Submission method

To submit a presentation proposal, send an e-mail to
[elc10@tree.celinuxforum.org](mailto:elc10@tree.celinuxforum.org)

A presentation proposal should include:

-   the name of the presenter
-   the presentation (or session) title
-   a brief (one or two paragraph) description
-   Also, please indicate with whether your presentation may be
    published by the forum on a web site, after the conference.

If you are submitting for someone else, please provide an e-mail address
for the presenter.

If your proposal is accepted, you will be requested to provide a short
paragraph describing yourself, for use in conference materials.

If you have any questions about the submission requirements, the status
of your submission, the review process, or the event itself, please feel
free to contact the program committee, at:
[elc10@tree.celinuxforum.org](mailto:elc10@tree.celinuxforum.org).

## Deadlines

Proposals for presentations, demos and Birds-of-a-Feather sessions must
be received by January 15, 2010.

Speakers will be notified by February 5, 2010.
