# Events/Kernel Summit 2011 ARM Subarch Maintainership Workshop


\< [Events](http://eLinux.org/Events "Events")


We're currently planning an ARM Subarchitecture Maintainership Workshop
for the first day of Kernel Summit in Prague, October 23, 2011. Watch
this page for details, or contact Grant Likely, Nicolas Pitre, or Arnd
Bergmann.

There is limited space available for this meeting. Seats were provided
on a first-come, first-served basis and we have now surpassed our
self-imposed limit of 24 people. However, if you still would like to
attend, or would like to nominate someone who you think is an important
participant, then email Grant Likely \<grant.likely@secretlab.ca\>. We
may be able to open up additional seats as needed.

We're also extending an open invite to all kernel summit invitees. If
you've been invited to kernel summit and you'd like to attend the ARM
workshop, then email Grant so that we know you are coming. Otherwise
we'll make you sit on the floor.
