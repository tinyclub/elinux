# CE Workgroup Projects - LinuxCon Japan 2015



The following projects are being presented by the CE Workgroup at
LinuxCon Japan 2015

Please come by our booth to talk to CE Workgroup representatives about
these projects. Our booth is located just outside the keynote hall.

## LTSI Test Project

-   An Open-source test framework for the LTSI kernel
-   See the presentation ["LTSI: Latest Status and Kernel
    Testing"](http://eLinux.org/images/c/c8/LTSI-_Latest_Status_and_Kernel_Testing.pdf "LTSI- Latest Status and Kernel Testing.pdf")
    from ELC 2015
-   See project details at:
    [http://ltsi.linuxfoundation.org/ltsi-test-project](http://ltsi.linuxfoundation.org/ltsi-test-project)
-   Code for the test framework can be downloaded from:
    [https://bitbucket.org/cogentembedded/jta-public/](https://bitbucket.org/cogentembedded/jta-public/)

## Shared Embedded Linux Distribution

-   This is a project to use Debian packages with the Yocto Project
    -   Goal is to share the work of maintaining long-term support for
        an embedded distribution, by leveraging the work of the Debian
        project
    -   The elinux page for this project is: [Shared Embedded Linux
        Distribution](http://eLinux.org/Shared_Embedded_Linux_Distribution "Shared Embedded Linux Distribution")
-   See ["Poky meets Debian: Understanding How to Make an Embedded Linux
    by Using an Existing Distribution's Source
    Code"](http://eLinux.org/images/1/1b/Poky_meets_Debian_Understanding_How_to_Make_an_Embedded_Linux_by_Using_an_Existing_Distribution%27s_Source_Code.pdf "Poky meets Debian Understanding How to Make an Embedded Linux by Using an Existing Distribution's Source Code.pdf")
    talk at ELC 2015 by Yoshitake Kobayashi

## Device Mainlining Project

-   This project aims to reduce the amount of out-of-tree code for
    Consumer Electronics projects (particularly mobile devices)
    -   Research shows that, on average, a mobile product based on Linux
        and Android has about 2 million lines of code out-of-mainline
    -   The main web page for this project is: [CE Workgroup Device
        Mainlining
        Project](../../.././dev_portals/Kernel_Mainlining/CE_Workgroup_Device_Mainlining_Project/CE_Workgroup_Device_Mainlining_Project.md "CE Workgroup Device Mainlining Project")
    -   Key activities include:
        -   Promotion of best practices for corporate guidance (e.g. the
            white paper)
        -   Collection and organization of links to mainlining tutorials
            and training materials
        -   Development of tools and information to assist companies
            with mainlining-related tasks
        -   Mainlining status analysis tools (see
            [https://github.com/tbird20d/upstream-analysis-tools](https://github.com/tbird20d/upstream-analysis-tools))
        -   Quantification of costs associated with out-of-tree code
        -   Providing assistance for upstream maintainers
-   The new ["Overcoming Obstacles to Mainlining" white
    paper](http://eLinux.org/images/e/ed/Overcoming-Obstacles-to-Mainlining-White-Paper-version-0.9.pdf "Overcoming-Obstacles-to-Mainlining-White-Paper-version-0.9.pdf")
    is published at LinuxCon Japan 2015 (June 3, 2015)
    -   Based on the presentation ["Overcoming Obstacles to Contributing
        to
        Linux"](http://eLinux.org/images/3/36/Overcoming_Obstacles_to_Contributing_to_Linux.pdf "Overcoming Obstacles to Contributing to Linux.pdf")
        presented at ELC 2015 by Tim Bird

## Linux in Infrastructure

-   This project aims to address requiremens for using Linux in civil
    and societal infrastructure projects
-   Presentation material is available at the following.
    -   ["Applying Linux to the Civil
        Infrastructure"](http://eLinux.org/images/7/74/Applying_Linux_to_the_Civil_Infrastructure-LinuxCon_Japan_2015.pdf "Applying Linux to the Civil Infrastructure-LinuxCon Japan 2015.pdf")

## eLinux wiki

-   The CE Workgroup continues to support this wiki, which has lots of
    information valuable to embedded Linux developers
    -   This includes technical presentations from the last 10 years of
        Embedded Linux Conference events, as well as wiki pages for lots
        of technical areas and CEWG's projects
