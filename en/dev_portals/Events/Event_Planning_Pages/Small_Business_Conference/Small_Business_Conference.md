## Events

### [LinuxCon](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/component/registrationpro/?func=details&did=1) & [Plumbers](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/component/registrationpro/?func=details&did=7) 2009

Is anyone interested in a BoF at LinuxCon 2009?

### [ELCE 2009](http://www.embeddedlinuxconference.com/elc_europe09/)

A "Small Business" BOF will happen at ELCE 2009

Conferences like ELC and ELCE are excellent opportunities for small
embedded Linux companies to meet, exchange experience and know each
other better. This makes it possible to cooperate on customer projects
which are too big for a single company, and to take advantage of the
specific skills of each partner.

We invite small business owners and employees to join this BOF. Here are
suggested topics:

-   Introducing one's company and main areas of expertise (2 slides max
    per company, to be sent to michael@free-electrons.com before the
    BOF)
-   Working with clients (preparing quotes, estimating, invoicing, etc)
-   Marketing, advertising, and building the business.
-   Project management
-   Relationship with the community, and with similar service providers
-   Relationship with vendors
-   Interest in an "Embedded Linux small business miniconf" at ELC 2010?

Your suggestions are welcome. Don't hesitate to add them to the above
list.

### ELC 2010

There is some talk about organizing a small business track or miniconf
as part of ELC 2010.
