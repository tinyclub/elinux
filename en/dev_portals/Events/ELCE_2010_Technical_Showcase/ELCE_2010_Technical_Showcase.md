# Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2010 Technical Showcase

We are happy to be planning a technical showcase again this year at
Embedded Linux Conference Europe. This Wiki page will guide you in
giving your demonstration. For conference details, please follow this

## Details

The demo session will be on Thursday, October 28th, between 12:35 and
14:30 in room Darwin. See [[the
agenda](http://www.embeddedlinuxconference.com/elc_europe10/program.html)].

The demo room will be available starting at ***8:00 pm*** for demo
setup.

## Objective

"Seeing is believing!" Unlike in Desktop or Server applications of
Linux, in embedded systems Linux technology is usually unseen. Although
it is a challenge, we want to expose Linux software and techniques so
that other developers who are interested in this technology can learn,
and become potential contributors themselves. We hope that through
opening up technical details and projects (in the way of Open Source
development), these demonstrations will provide insights that are
helpful to developers.

## Criteria

-   No *purely* commercial demonstrations.
-   The Embedded Linux Conference Europe should not be used for a pure
    sales pitch.
-   You can show off a product, if there are features or aspects of the
    product you are displaying that are open source.
-   Demonstrations should be of software that is available under GPL or
    LGPL compatible licenses.

## Coordinator

# What will be prepared by CE Linux Forum

CE Linux Forum will provide the following **FREE OF CHARGE** :

-   A Demonstration desk, which is half of a table
    If you need special arrangements, please contact the coordinator.

[![Desk sample from ELC
2006](http://eLinux.org/images/e/eb/Elc2006-showcase-desksample.jpg)](http://eLinux.org/File:Elc2006-showcase-desksample.jpg "Desk sample from ELC 2006")

-   Power supply TBD: UK and or EU standard
-   Assuming the power is less than 750W. If your demonstration will
    exceed that, please consult the coordinator.
-   A large-format printed poster, based on the file you submit.
-   Please note that a dedicated (wired) Internet connection will
    **NOT** be prepared. However, wireless Internet may be available via
    the hotel wireless network. We cannot, however, guarantee Internet
    access.
-   Logistics Support
-   Details will be given to the demonstrators

## Dimension of the desk

-   Please refer to the attached photo.

## Poster

All demonstrators are requested to prepare a poster to explain the
technical outline of the demonstration. You can download the template
from this page. CELF will print them out on large size paper. The
document should be sent to the coordinator by October 11th.

-   [ELCE2010\_PosterForm.odp](http://eLinux.org/images/e/e0/ELCE2010_PosterForm.odp "ELCE2010 PosterForm.odp")
-   [ELCE2010\_PosterForm.ppt](http://eLinux.org/images/8/8c/ELCE2010_PosterForm.ppt "ELCE2010 PosterForm.ppt")

**Caution**: Do not change the paper size. It is intentionally set to a
big size.

## Some tips

The demo consists of a poster (printed by CELF), with a few sentences
talking about a tool, technology or distribution and a table top where
you can place anything from:

1.  nothing at all, just have a person sitting there to talk to people
    about what's on the poster, or ...
2.  something on a laptop - like a program running or a even a static
    chart showing some result
3.  something running on a board or a device
4.  something on an actual CE product

You can also put some flyers there for people to grab, if you'd like.

If you can put charts and graphs on the poster, that's nice but it is
NOT required. Neither the poster nor the hardware (if any) needs to be
elaborate or require lots of setup. One year I showed up with a
camcorder and just talked to people about it's bootup time (which I had
worked on).

If you are a presenter, the demo session is a good chance to talk to
people one-on-one about your session topic. This gives you more time for
interactive Q&A, and a chance to show something hands-on, if that
applies to your subject.

# How to apply

1.  Send an e-mail to the coordinator with the following information:
    1.  The contact person, the company name or the project name, the
        outline of the demonstration.
    2.  The coordinator will acknowledge your application by e-mail.

2.  Prepare the poster and send the data to CELF Office and the
    demonstration coordinator by **October 11th**. It will be printed
    out by the conference organizers on big size paper.
    1.  Prepare the demonstration equipment
    2.  You can bring the equipment yourself, or ship it.
    3.  If you do not have a consignee which will be convenient for you,
        send them to the following address: *Address not available yet*

# FAQ

-   **Q**: Is this opportunity limited to CELF members?
-   **A**: No. You do not have to be a forum member to have a demo at
    the conference. However, each demo should be associated with a paid
    conference attendee.
-   **Q**: Is the demonstrator required to make a presentation at the
    conference?
-   **A**: No, this is not required. However, we believe there will be
    many people who will to be interested in details of the technology,
    so we hope that you can have a session. Please note that the due
    date for a session proposal is earlier than the due date for demo
    sign-up.
-   **Q**: Should I assign some dedicated staff to carry on the
    demonstration?
-   **A**: No, this is not necessary. There will be a dedicated time
    slot for the demos that will be separate from the other technical
    sessions. So there should be no conflict between the demo session
    and the other technical sessions.
-   **Q**: Is there any fee to demo something in this session?
-   **A**: No, it is completely free. However, the session is limited to
    conference attendees, so please register for the conference if you
    would not otherwise do so. If you have someone coming who will ONLY
    run or assist with your demo, and not attend any sessions, then that
    person may be admitted for free, for just the demo session (and
    setup and take down). However, each demo should be associated with
    at least one registered attendee.
