# Kexecboot



Kexecboot is a program that implements a second-stage bootloader using a
stripped-down Linux and the 'kexec' feature to boot into the final
running Linux image.

The Kexecboot code reads a configuration file, scans partitions at boot
time, and presents a GUI from which the user can select an option.
