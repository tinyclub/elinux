# JuiceBox FAQ Hard Things



## FAQ on things that are HARD

-   Video Player

The video cartridges from Mattel contain a memory chip that has the
video information AND proprietary video player software. The
[JuiceBox](http://eLinux.org/JuiceBox "JuiceBox") itself only has enough intelligence to
load the video player from the video cartridge.

-   Video Monitor

While the Juicebox can play video from cartridges, the display itself is
wholely a digital LCD driven directly by drivers on the CPU chip. There
is no point inside the box where there is anything resembling a normal
video signal, so it is next to impossible to get the JB to display video
from (for example) a camera.

-   Serial Terminal

The [JuiceBox](http://eLinux.org/JuiceBox "JuiceBox") does contain a serial port, but the
normal juicebox software turns this off, so using the JB as a serial
display involves running new software on it.
