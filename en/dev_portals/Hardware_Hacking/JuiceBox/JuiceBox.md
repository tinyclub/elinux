NOTE:

for those who are viewing this page for the first time and are
considering hacking the **JuiceBox** you should be aware of some facts.
my primary reason for hacking the **JuiceBox** was not to make a mp3
player, picture viewier, or movie player. i never ment for the
**JuiceBox** hack to be anything other than an inexpensive platform to
experiment with design concepts. this includes experimentation with NAND
flash, NOR flash, arm7tdmi architecture, bootloaders, SD/MMC card
interfaces, and uClinux. if your intentions for hacking the **JuiceBox**
are for anything other than education, you will probably be
disappointed. -[prpplague](http://eLinux.org/User:Prpplague "User:Prpplague")

## Lesser Hacks

The discontinuation of sales of the **JuiceBox** moves some previously
trivial applications into the realm of *lesser hacks*; things that
require some degree of documentation and effort, but no actual hardware
modifications of the **JuiceBox** itself.
