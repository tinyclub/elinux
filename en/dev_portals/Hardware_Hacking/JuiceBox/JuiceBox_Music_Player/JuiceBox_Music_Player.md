# JuiceBox Music Player



## Music Player

The MP3/Photo adaptor is just a physical adaptor from the [Cartridge
slot](http://eLinux.org/JuiceBox_Slot "JuiceBox Slot")] to a standard MMC/SD flash memory
card. If you can't buy the adaptor, you may be able to make one
following instructions here
[MMChack](http://eLinux.org/JuiceBox_MMCHack "JuiceBox MMCHack")]. The
[JuiceBox](http://eLinux.org/JuiceBox "JuiceBox") software plays standard 128kbps MP3
files from the root directory of the flash card. Some versions of the
software support other bit rates, and others refuse to play the files or
have bugs.
