# Delta F



## Welcome

This is my [ZipIt](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt "ZipIt") wiki page..

My attempt to format the [ZipIt Framebuffer
Example](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt_Framebuffer_Example "ZipIt Framebuffer Example") for
Bomberman

### New [ZipIt](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt "ZipIt") Firmware

It appears that I'll be finally learning about cross-compilation very
soon. I'm interested in your wishlist for software on your
[ZipIt](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt "ZipIt") and I'll take into consideration your ideas as I
work on my own firmware image.

The mysterious "Adam Firmware" seems to be the best starting point
though I intend to research some of the tricks used in [OpenWRT
firmware](http://openwrt.org/) for this device such as jffs2, ipkg so
that we may modularize and EASILY customize our own installations
without mucking about with unfamiliar and potentially dangerous tasks
such as using *dd*.

I think that functionality requests should be broken down by functions
and/or networking requirements:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><strong>Offline tools</strong></td>
<td align="left">For use with or without AP</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><strong>Network discovery</strong></td>
<td align="left">To find wireless APs, auto connect, sniff..</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><strong>Network tools</strong></td>
<td align="left">Chat, ssh, the usual that require the Internet</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><strong>Networked with storage</strong></td>
<td align="left">Tools that require NFS/SMB mounts to be useful</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><strong>Misc utils</strong></td>
<td align="left">Helpful linux tools not currently present</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Please append or modify within this page as you see fit.
