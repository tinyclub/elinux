# OpenZipIt



**OpenZipIt** is an open-source firmware for the [ZipIt](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt "ZipIt")
wireless messenger. **OpenZipIt** was developed by cynfab (KenMcGuire)
in April 2005. Since release, there has been no more major development
on it. However, there are renewed interests in expanding and continuing
to develop the firmware by several members of the
[ZipItWireless](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/zipitwireless/) community.

It is avaiable for download at the *zipitwireless* Yahoo group
[here](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/zipitwireless/files/OpenZipit/).
For instructions on installing this firmware, please see [ZipIt WiFi
Flash](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt_WiFi_Flash "ZipIt WiFi Flash") and
[OpenZipIt\_No\_Flash\_Test](http://eLinux.org/OpenZipIt_No_Flash_Test "OpenZipIt No Flash Test").

## What's included in **OpenZipIt**?

In general **OpenZipIt** is a collection of sources, patches and How
To's that describe a set of replacement applications for the Zipit
Instant Messaging device. It is (hopefully) a work in progress and
should not be considered complete in its current form.

-   aumix: ncurses audio mixer control panel
-   busybox: [BusyBox](http://eLinux.org/BusyBox "BusyBox") combines tiny versions of
    many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It
    provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in
    GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc.
-   dropbear v.45: ssh client & server Note that for the current version
    to connect, the ssh server must have the
    `PasswordAuthentication yes` setting in its config file.
-   libid3tag: id3tag library
-   libmad: mp3 decoder library
-   madplay: mp3 player using the libmad & libid3tag libraries
-   uClibc: glibc replacement library. This is in support of weechat,
    and other ncurses based programs.
-   freebase: This is a simple streaming audio application that uses the
    libmad mp3 decoder library. In its original form, freebase had some
    serious problems, this is my attempt to fix them. The original code
    was not under development, but this is not a fork, just an
    adaptation for the Zipit. The copyright remains with the original
    owner.
-   weechat: This is an IRC client that supports an ncurses interface.

The mp3 players included are intended to demonstrate that playing mp3's
and doing streaming audio on the Zipit is possible. They still have some
issues with data rates, and skipping. The only way those problems will
be solved is by having more eyes look at the code and better minds than
mine thinking about those problems.

The audio drivers are built as modules and must be loaded prior to using
the sound system. They can be loaded by running the "go2" shell script
included in **OpenZipIt**.

## Installing **OpenZipIt**

This relatively simple process will allow you to install the more fully
featured **OpenZipIt** firmware. Before you install **OpenZipIt**, you
must have already installed the [BURN3](http://eLinux.org/BURN3 "BURN3") firmware as
described in [ZipIt WiFi Flash](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt_WiFi_Flash "ZipIt WiFi Flash").
Once you have installed **OpenZipIt**, the same basic process is also
used to install custom firmware over [WiFi](http://eLinux.org/WiFi "WiFi"), you simply
replace the **OpenZipIt** files with your custom versions.

## Modifying The **OpenZipIt** Ramdisk Image

You will likely want to add some shell scripts or make other changes to
the file system to make your [ZipIt](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt "ZipIt") better suit your
needs. Keep in mind the limited free space on the
[ZipIt](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt "ZipIt")'s ROM and the fact that if you screw up you'll
have to do the 3-wire mod.

On your linux box:

1.  Unzip ramdisk.gz file.
2.  mkdir /mnt/image
3.  mount -o loop ramdisk /mnt/image
4.  cd /mnt/image
5.  Make your desired changes.
6.  cd back to the directory housing your ramdisk file.
7.  umount /mnt/image
8.  gzip -9 ramdisk
9.  Re-flash your zipit, using the new ramdisk.gz image instead of the
    offical **OpenZipIt** version.

An alternate way is to use the genziplinefs.sh script from the Files -\>
Development System Tools folder. It is derived from the genext2fs.sh
from buildroot, and starts with the root dir generated by buildroot.
Reading its source can be helpful in understanding what is going on when
building a ramdisk.gz image from a set of files. The script uses
utilities built by buildroot, so it probably won't work if you don't
have a development environment set up.
