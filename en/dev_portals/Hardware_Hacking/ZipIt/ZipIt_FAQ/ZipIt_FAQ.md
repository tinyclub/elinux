16-bit PC Card chipset, usually found in CF 802.11b cards. The
[ZipIt](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt "ZipIt") wires it up with a minimum of glue chips to fake
the PC Card interface. This chipset only understands 802.11b, so it is
not possible to use the new modulation modes of 802.11g or the faster
speeds of 802.11g on the [ZipIt](http://eLinux.org/ZipIt "ZipIt"). All 802.11g access

point.
