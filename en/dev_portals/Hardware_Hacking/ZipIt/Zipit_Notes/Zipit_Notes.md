# Zipit Notes



# 1/14/06

This page will hopefully contain additional notes on getting and using
zipit.

In my case, I cannot seem to post to the Yahoo site. So my comments are
posted here:

I have been carrying zipit around and using it as a pocket notepad.
Works pretty well. Occasionally it does not powerup successfully? Also,
the e3 editor has an arm binary and that is much easier to use.

Has anyone figured out how to automatically scan the various open
wireless nodes that zipit detects like the OEM zipit application does?
