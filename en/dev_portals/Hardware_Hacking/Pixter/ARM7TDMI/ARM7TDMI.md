# ARM7TDMI



ARM 32-bit RISC core with 16-bit system costs

The ARM7TDMI core is a 32-bit embedded RISC processor delivered as a
hard macrocell optimized to provide the best combination of performance,
power and area characteristics. The ARM7TDMI core enables system
designers to build embedded devices requiring small size, low power and
high performance.

The ARM7 family also includes the ARM7TDMI-S and ARM7EJ-S cores and the
ARM720T macrocell, each of which has been developed to address different
market requirements.

The ARM7TDMI core is available via the ARM Foundry Program
