# Pixter Camera



The Pixter Camera is an add on cartridge for the Pixter , this is
probably the best cart to use for development since the cart is screwed
together (others have the plastic cases bonded together making it
difficult to open without damaging the case), has almost all the pins
for the external connector used, and has plenty of room for a custom
pcb. the main camera board also includes a ccd imager board, plus two
Cypress CY62127 64K x 16 Static RAM chips (
[Media:CY62127.pdf](http://eLinux.org/images/3/32/CY62127.pdf "CY62127.pdf") ) and two
SST 39VF400A 256K x 16-Bit Multi-Purpose Flash chips (
[Media:SST39VF400.pdf](http://eLinux.org/images/7/74/SST39VF400.pdf "SST39VF400.pdf") ).


 retail cost for the pixter camera is around \$30.00
