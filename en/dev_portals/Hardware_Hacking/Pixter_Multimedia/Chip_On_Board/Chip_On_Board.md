# Chip On Board



A bare chip (die) that is mounted directly onto the printed circuit
board (PCB). After the wires are attached, a glob of epoxy or plastic is
used to cover the chip and its connections. The tape automated bonding
(TAB) process is used to place the chip on the board. The bare chip is
adhered and wire bonded to the board, and an epoxy is poured over it to
insulate and protect it.
