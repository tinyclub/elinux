# Enc28j60



## Introduction

Microchip's `ENC28J60` is a 28-pin, 10BASE-T stand alone Ethernet
Controller with on board MAC & PHY, 8 Kbytes of Buffer RAM and an SPI
serial interface. With a small foot print package size the `ENC28J60`
minimizes complexity, board space and cost. Target applications include
VoIP, Industrial Automation, Building Automation, Home Control, Security
and Instrumentation.

## Evaluation Boards

 Linux Drivers

-   [2.4 Kernel
    Driver](http://eLinux.org/images/e/e6/Enc28j60-2.4-x.tar.gz "Enc28j60-2.4-x.tar.gz")
    , this an experimental driver to test the basic features of the
    enc28j60 under linux. it was done using the s3c2410 arm920t. this
    driver can be modified to work with other spi controllers including
    bitbanging. this is a VERY ugly hack and is not ment to be a
    production driver.
-   2.6 Kernel Driver no SPI subsystem , this is the initial driver
    support for the enc28j60. this driver uses a spi interface header
    that describes the device being used. (Completed, waiting on lawyers
    approval for release)
-   2.6 Kernel Driver with SPI Subsystem, this version of the driver
    supports the new SPI subsystem that is available from 2.6.16 and
    newer. (ETA 8/28/2006 update: there is a driver in the Linux Kernel
    - .../drivers/net/ethernet/microchip/enc28j60.c)
