# Cortex



The ARM Cortex family comprises three series, which all implement the
Thumb-2 instruction set to address the increasing performance and cost
demands of various markets:

-   ARM Cortex-A Series, applications processors for complex OS and user
    applications.Supports the ARM, Thumb and Thumb-2 instruction sets
-   ARM Cortex-R Series, embedded processors for real-time systems.
    Supports the ARM, Thumb, and Thumb-2 instruction sets
-   ARM Cortex-M Series, deeply embedded processors optimized for cost
    sensitive applications. Supports the Thumb-2 instruction set only
