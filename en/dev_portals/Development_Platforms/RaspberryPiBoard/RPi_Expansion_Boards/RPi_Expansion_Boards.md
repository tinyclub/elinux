## Introduction

On the Raspberry Pi, there are several connections which can be used for
expansion:

-   The [Rpi
    GPIO](http://eLinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals "RPi Low-level peripherals")
    (General Purpose Input/Output) pins are exposed, that means that
    expansion boards are able to talk directly to the CPU.
-   The DSI connector will allow low-level interfacing with LCDs and
    other displays.
-   The CSI connector will allow camera modules to be added in future.

## Expansion boards by functions

### Power Supply and Control

#### BattBorg

[![](http://eLinux.org/images/thumb/d/d5/BattBorg.jpg/300px-BattBorg.jpg)](http://eLinux.org/File:BattBorg.jpg)

[](http://eLinux.org/File:BattBorg.jpg "Enlarge")

[BattBorg](https://www.piborg.org/battborg)

[BattBorg](https://www.piborg.org/battborg) is a power converter for
your Raspberry Pi which allows you to power the Raspberry Pi off
batteries. It will work with most batteries/battery packs that are
between 7-36V so it's great for 12V car batteries, 8xAA battery packs,
and so on. Perfect for autonomous robot projects where using a USB
charger is not an option.

#### Meltwater's Switched Mode Power Supply Kit

This is a DC to DC [switched mode power
supply](http://www.pihardware.co.uk), another great add on board in
Meltwater's range. It comes as a kit of parts, ready to be soldered
together. This can supply a 5 volt output to a Raspberry Pi from an
input of anywhere from 7 to 40 volts!

Testing has shown that the unit is around 80% efficient, where a
comparable linear regulator (such as LM350T) was measured under 50%
(based on a quick test).

#### Pi Supply Switch

[The Pi Supply
Switch](http://www.pi-supply.com/product/pi-supply-raspberry-pi-power-switch/)
is an "intelligent" power management device for the Raspberry Pi made by
Pi Supply. This add on board has hard on/off switches as well as a soft
shutdown switch, which initiates a safe shutdown using a simple Python
script. It allows you to cycle power on the Raspberry Pi without
plugging and unplugging either your "wall-wart" power supply, or the
micro-USB plug input to your Pi. It includes an LED status indicator,
and 3 mounting holes for easy use in any project you have in mind. It
needs only one GPIO pin to operate, with the option of using a second
GPIO pin to add the safe shutdown functionality.

It is an Open Source project, and comes with free stickers and a free
noodle USB cable to connect to your Pi.

The Pi Supply was funded using the crowdfunding site,
Kickstarter.<sup>[[1]](#cite_note-1)</sup>

#### Power Pi

[![](http://eLinux.org/images/thumb/2/26/PowerPi_A2a.png/300px-PowerPi_A2a.png)](http://eLinux.org/File:PowerPi_A2a.png)

[](http://eLinux.org/File:PowerPi_A2a.png "Enlarge")

[PowerPi](http://andicelabs.com/power-pi)

The [PowerPi](http://andicelabs.com/power-pi) is a flexible power supply
and control board. It can power the Raspberry Pi from a 4-14VDC source
or a single-cell Lithium-Ion battery. It has integrated battery
charging, switch-over, and monitoring. The AVR power supervisor allows
the Pi to be powered on and off autonomously and also provides RTC and
watchdog functionality.

#### RPI Alim

[RPI Alim](http://www.yadom.fr/carte-rpi-alim.html) is a inexpensive
board that gives the possibility of powering the Raspberry with a 7V to
15V DC power supply or battery.

#### RemotePi Board

[![](http://eLinux.org/images/thumb/2/22/RemotePiBoard.jpg/300px-RemotePiBoard.jpg)](http://eLinux.org/File:RemotePiBoard.jpg)

[](http://eLinux.org/File:RemotePiBoard.jpg "Enlarge")

[RemotePi Board](http://www.msldigital.com/)

The [RemotePi Board](http://www.msldigital.com/products/remotepi-board)
is an intelligent infrared remote controlled power switch add-on board
for the Raspberry Pi. It allows to switch power on and off using any
button (configurable in learning mode) of an existing standard IR
remote. Power is only cut after notifying the OS and giving it time to
shut-down. It is mainly intended to remote control (using LIRC) and
power off/on a mediacenter system. i.e OpenELEC, Raspbmc, XBian,
RasPlex, Raspbian. The board is compatible to simple GPIO IR receiver
and piggy backs onto the Raspberry Pi, no soldering required. For more
information click
[here](http://www.msldigital.com/pages/more-information).

#### 3V3 DC-DC Switched Mode Regulator

The Raspberry Pi uses a linear regulator to convert the input 5V to 3V3.
This converter can be replaced with a more efficient switching mode to
reduce the power needed. This can be useful when running the Pi on
battery. More information and a ready-to-buy kit be found
[here](http://bitwizard.nl/wiki/index.php/Reducing_power_consumption_of_a_raspberry_Pi)



#### Pi Jumper & Pi Jumper Plus (GPIO breakout, 3v3 power, 3v3 & 5V I2C)

#### Pi Tin

Not yet tested, comments welcome Project files for Eagle here:
[[4]](http://www.delong.com/Raspberry%20PI/) Schematic and Board images:
[[5]](http://elinux.org/File:PiTin_Schematic.png)
[[6]](http://elinux.org/File:PiTin_Boardpng.png) This board uses
Microchip 16-pin GPIO expanders driven by SPI to provide up to 256
additional GPIO pins at a very low cost. Optionally, it can supply power
for the board and the Raspberry PI.

The board can be made in a stackable manner allowing you to also place
additional peripherals on the GPIO connector. It makes non-exclusive use
of all four SPI pins as well as exclusive use of the CE0 Pin.

If you install (and power) the power supply components, the board will
supply up to 1A at 5VDC. This is not enough to power all GPIO pins on a
fully populated board, but in most applications should be sufficient to
power the RPI and a reasonable number of GPIOs. An external power supply
should be used for higher-power applications. This board should never be
powered from the RPI as even one of the chips can draw more than the RPI
can provide.

The power supply is quite flexible and will accept anything from 8-25VAC
or 8-42VDC. It is based on a Recom module which provides a switching
power supply in a form factor that is a drop-in replacement for 7805
series TO-220 linear regulators.

The 8 chips can be had for about \$4@ or less and the power supply
components total about \$15. A fully populated board is about \$49+PCB,
\$31+PCB for 64 GPIO pins.

You can have the PCB made at a variety of fabricators.

style connector for XRF / XBee / RN-XV / XBT / RF-BEE etc. Has the SPI
and I2C pins on one standard 8 way header and the Raspberry PI's 8
general purpose I/O pins on another for easy access. Comes as a kit of
parts that needs to be soldered. Construction is very easy and suitable
for children with basic soldering skills.

[Slice of PI/O](http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/k002-slice-of-pi-o/) is a
variation of the above produced by Ciseco based upon [Nathan Chantrell's
MCP23017/Slice of Pi
"project"](http://nathan.chantrell.net/20120602/raspberry-pi-io-expander-board/).
The MCP23017 may be powered from either the Pi's 3.3V/5.0V GPIO pins or,
with care, an external psu. The use of a 5.0V power source means that
the MCP23017's 16 (2 x 8) GPIO's can interface directly with 5V logic
families etc. However, the Pi's own GPIO's, also available, will still
need 3.3V - 5.0V level shifters. [Trevor
Gowen](http://eLinux.org/User:TrevorGowen "User:TrevorGowen")'s experimental [LED
BarGraph
"board"](http://www.cpmspectrepi.webspace.virginmedia.com/raspberry_pi/MoinMoinExport/SliceOfPio.html)
has been "piggy-backed" onto one of these.

### Programmable

#### Guzunty

The Guzunty Pi adds open source programmable hardware to the Raspberry
Pi at an amazingly low price. The design contains a 72 macrocell
programmable logic device, so the board functions like a 'virtual
breadboard'. This board is ideal for those with many different projects
in mind, because it is so flexible. It can be a simple IO expander, a 7
segment LED driver, provide servo and regular PWM outputs, or anything
you can dream up that will fit into 1600 logic gates. The device is '5
volt tolerant' and so can be used to safely interface 5v logic devices
(such as Arduino) to the 3.3v Raspberry Pi. The [GitHub community
site](https://github.com/Guzunty/Pi/wiki) contains many ready made cores
that you can download and use directly. You can design your own custom
cores using industry standard languages such as VHDL or Verilog.

#### LOGI-PI

The LOGI-PI
([http://valentfx.com/logi-pi/](http://valentfx.com/logi-pi/)) is an
FPGA-based daughter board for the raspberry-pi. It consists in a Spartan
6 LX9 FPGA from Xilinx, 32MB SDRAM, PMODS (standardized IO connector)
and an Arduino compatible connector. The board communicates with the
raspberry-pi through SPI and comes with VHDL support file and Python/C
support software. The Raspberry-pi can directly programm the FPGA thus
eliminating the need for an expensive FPGA programmer. A web based-tool
([http://www.valentfx.com/skeleton/](http://www.valentfx.com/skeleton/))
allow the user to design the architecture to be run on the FPGA without
the need of writing a single line of HDL code. The LOGI-Pi comes with
several demo applications inculing bitcoin mining, vision processing
(with the optionnal camera module) and more.
