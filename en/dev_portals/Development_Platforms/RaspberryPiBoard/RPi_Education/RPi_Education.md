## The Manual

The
[manual](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/Raspberry_Pi_Education_Manual.pdf)
was completed in late 2012 by members of the [Computing At
School](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/) working group. It was made
available via the [Raspberry Pi
foundation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2965) on the 2nd January
2013.

It is aimed at the project's target audience, children, so that they can
take their "First steps in Computing and Computer Science".

Originally contributions to the educational manual could be placed here
in the [Manual
contribution](http://eLinux.org/RPi_Education/Manual "RPi Education/Manual") page.

Now there is a [thread on the Raspberry Pi
Forum](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=28097) for
errata, corrections and omissions.

## Your Projects

**Doing a project at school or have a Raspberry Pi Club? Add it in this
section to allow others to follow your progress!**

Please add details of your group and what plans you have for the RPi or
provide a link to your homepage.

### Organizations

### Swansea ITeC

We're running a 'Raspberry PITeC' project unded by an RSC Wales
Technology for Learning Small Grant program to engage our Traineeship
learners in more hands on IT. We're keeping a blog of the process -
[Social Pi](http://techpi.wordpress.com) - which staff and learners will
contribute to and as part of the grant process will be releasing all
resources we create, which will probably involve a Moodle course, back
into the community. We're also maintaining a
[Diigo](http://groups.diigo.com/group/raspberry-pitec) list of useful
resources we find along the way.

#### Puppy *hacker* School

For smarter kids of all ages, teachers, self-tutored and the fast
learner. Based on [doacracy](http://puppylinux.org/wikka/Organisation)
principles of *learning by doing* [Puppy Hacker
School](http://puppylinux.org/wikka/PuppySchoolProgramming) is open for
learning on your existing hardware, using [Puppy
Linux](http://puppylinux.org). Whilst awaiting your first punnet of
raspberries, get cracking. [All bones
welcome](http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=604710#604710).

#### Computer History Museum, Silicon Valley

[The Computer History Museum](http://www.ComputerHistory.org) in the
heart of Silicon Valley in Mountain View, California, has an educational
program which provides resources to educators and students from
pre-school up through graduate school levels. Museum staff and
volunteers provide tours of the museum's exhibits that contain the
largest collection of computing artifacts in the world, from the abacus
through massively-parallel supercomputers. Modern computing fundamentals
are introduced, from how individual transistor circuits hold binary
values, through data processing, input/output, short and long-term
storage, and a wide variety of software, from the earliest punched card
programs to current operating systems and programming languages. We will
be coordinating hosting Raspberry Pi user groups in the area after
boards start being delivered, and will provide assistance to educators
and students in setting up their R-Pi systems and learning how to
perform software development, from games to whatever anyone wants. We
will also participate in developing educational documentation in the
[eLinux.org R-Pi wiki](http://elinux.org/RaspberryPiBoard) and
contributing to the [Computing At School
(CAS)](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk) initiative.

### Schools

#### Manchester Grammar School Computing Society, The

A new co-curricular club for Y9 boys aimed squarely at the new "UK
Computing in Schools" initiative. Details of what we're doing are on the
[MGS Computing Society
page](http://eLinux.org/MGS_Computing_Society_page "MGS Computing Society page").

#### Winsford E-Act Academy Programming Club

This is an after-school club set up to encourage students to learn
programming and more about how computers work. There's a blog site to
support the club at [teampython](http://teampython.wordpress.com/). We
are very excited about the Raspberry Pi and can't wait to get our hands
on one. For the time being, we are learning Python 3 with Pygame. To get
the students used to using Linux, we are using a remaster of Puppy
that's available here:
[RacyPy2](http://teampython.wordpress.com/2012/03/03/while-you-wait-for-your-raspberry-pi-why-not-use-racypy2/).
Anyone who wants to join in online or share ideas is very welcome!

#### Trinity School Computer Club

Plans for setting up the club based on headless RPi is shown in the
[RPI\_Trinity\_Computer\_Club](http://eLinux.org/RPI_Trinity_Computer_Club "RPI Trinity Computer Club")
page.

### Universities

#### Kent - School of Computing, The University of

Many of both the students and staff at the [School of
Computing](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/) have been following the Raspberry
Pi for a long time and are eagerly waiting to get started on projects
using them. We are also strong supporters of the Foundation's objective
in getting more young people interested in "real" computing rather than
just playing games or web browsing.

#### Manchester - School of Computer Science, University of

[Pi Projects at Manchester](http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk). We've got a
competition for the best Raspberry Pi Project starting soon, and are
getting activities together for schools and youth groups.

We want to use the Raspberry Pi with a simple hardware board and set of
downloadable activities to use it to encourage young people (or anyone
else) get into embedded computing. We're currently looking at
[piface](http://piface.openlx.org.uk) for the interface board and trying
to come up with little activities to do. We've got some ideas but would
love some more if anyone else wants to get involved.

We already run Linux workshops for schools and the [National UK Schools
Animation Competition](http://animation12.cs.manchester.ac.uk), which
uses Scratch.
