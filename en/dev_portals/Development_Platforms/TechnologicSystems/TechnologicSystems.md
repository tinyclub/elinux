Technologic Systems (
[http://www.embeddedarm.com](http://www.embeddedarm.com)) offers some
nice boards that are usable as development boards but also as OEM
modules to integrate into your products.

Especially the TS-7300 is a very nice board build around the Cirrus
Logic [EP9312
SoC](http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=2&q=http://www.cirrus.com/en/pubs/proDatasheet/EP9312_PP7.pdf&ei=lKHaSayGAaiEtAORo_3NBg&usg=AFQjCNECAA5mFXS_jAAXEpw49NMujvAsOw)
to experiment with FPGA technology. This board contains a completely
unoccupied FPGA that can be programmed from the main CPU.
