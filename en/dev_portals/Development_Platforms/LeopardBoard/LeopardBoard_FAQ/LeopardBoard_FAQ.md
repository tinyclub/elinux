## Solutions to common problems

### How do I use USB in host mode

In order to accomplish USB host mode on Leopard, some hardware
modifications need to be done. For more details visit: [USB Host Mode
(HW)](http://designsomething.org/leopardboard/f/22/t/73.aspx)

Besides the hardware modifications, the
[Media:usb\_mouse.patch](http://eLinux.org/images/a/a9/Usb_mouse.patch "Usb mouse.patch")
needs to be applied on kernel 2.6.29.
