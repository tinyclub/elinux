# Developer Certificate Of Origin



In May 2004, the kernel development community decided to standardize on
a requirement to adhere to a Developer Certificate of Origin for
contributions to the Linux kernel.

The text of the DCO is located in the file
[Documentation/SubmittingPatches](http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
in the Linux kernel source tree.

The full text of the DCO version 1.1 (the current version as of 2011)
is:

            Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

            By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

            (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
                have the right to submit it under the open source license
                indicated in the file; or

            (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
                of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
                license and I have the right under that license to submit that
                work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
                by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
                permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
                in the file; or

            (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
                person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
                it.

            (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
                are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
                personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
                maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
                this project or the open source license(s) involved.

There is a kernel thread discussing the original proposal from Linus
[here (google
groups).](http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&threadm=1YUY7-6fF-11%40gated-at.bofh.it&rnum=1&prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dg:thl3436074442d%26dq%3D%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26selm%3D1YUY7-6fF-11%2540gated-at.bofh.it)
And [here

Here is another article describing rationale for the 1.1 version:

Origin](http://kerneltrap.org/node/5277) KernelTrap, June 14, 2005

## Example

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, that indicates the submitter
accepts the DCO:

    Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@hisdomain.com>

## Older versions

The original DCO, version 1.0, read:

        Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.0

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right
        to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge,
        is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that
        license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a
        different license), as indicated in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
        certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.
