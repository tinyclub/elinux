# PowerPC



PowerPC is a RISC microprocessor architecture created by the 1991
Apple–IBM–Motorola alliance, known as AIM. Originally intended for
personal computers, PowerPC CPUs have since become popular embedded and
high-performance processors as well. PowerPC was the cornerstone of
AIM's PReP and Common Hardware Reference Platform initiatives in the
1990s, but the architecture found the most success in the personal
computer market in Apple's Macintosh lines from 1994 to 2006 (before
Apple's transition to Intel).

PowerPC is largely based on IBM's earlier POWER architecture, and
retains a high level of compatibility with it; the architectures have
remained close enough that the same programs and operating systems will
run on both if some care is taken in preparation; newer chips in the
POWER series implement the full PowerPC instruction set.

Today, SOCs are available for embedded applications based on the PowerPC
architecture, e. g. the [Freescale
MPC5200](../../../.././dev_portals/Boot_Time/Fast_Kernel_Decompression/PowerPC/Freescale_MPC5200/Freescale_MPC5200.md "Freescale MPC5200") and the [PPC405
GP](../../../.././dev_portals/Boot_Time/Fast_Kernel_Decompression/PowerPC/PPC405_GP/PPC405_GP.md "PPC405 GP").
