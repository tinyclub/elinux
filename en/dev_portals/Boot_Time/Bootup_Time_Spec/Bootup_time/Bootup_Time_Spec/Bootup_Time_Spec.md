# Bootup Time Spec



This is the specification of [bootup time](http://eLinux.org/Bootup_time "Bootup time")
technologies and features, of the [Bootup Time Working
Group](http://eLinux.org/Bootup_Time_Working_Group "Bootup Time Working Group") of the CE
Linux Forum.

## Introduction

The specifications of the Bootup Time Working Group deals with reducing
the time required to boot a Linux kernel in a consumer electronics
products. The purpose of this specification is to define requested or
required features of Linux which improve the bootup time of the system
for such products. Also, this specification mentions features which,
over the long term, will assist developers in measuring and enhancing
the bootup time for their systems.

While suspend, resume, and shutdown times are also within the scope of
the Bootup Time Working Group, this version 1.0 of specifications does
not include any technology in support of reductions in these areas.
Reductions in those areas will be covered in future versions of the
specification.

## Rationale

Users expect to be able to use their CE products very soon after turning
them on. Linux, as configured and used for desktop and server systems,
exhibits long bootup times - on the order of 30 seconds to a few
minutes. The technologies mentioned here (while small in number, in this
first release), represent a few mechanisms which can be used to reduce
bootup time.

## Terminology

The following table presents terms used in this specification related to
bootup time technology and features.











## Work In Progress

The following item is currently being worked on, but is not ready for
publication yet.
