## About this site

This is the official Wiki for embedded Tegra & the Jetson TK1 board,
maintained by both the community and NVIDIA.

The other embedded Tegra community sites with official NVIDIA support
are:

-   The [forum](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/board/139/) for
    discussing embedded Tegra & Jetson TK1 issues with the community &
    NVIDIA.
-   The [blog](https://plus.google.com/114318922342198493952) to stay
    updated with the latest news & plans for embedded Tegra & Jetson TK1
    from NVIDIA.

### About Tegra K1

Tegra K1 is NVIDIA's first mobile processor to have the same advanced
features & architecture as a modern desktop GPU while still using the
low power draw of a mobile chip. The Jetson TK1 board therefore allows
embedded devices to use the exact same CUDA code that would also run on
a desktop GPU (used by over 100,000 developers), with similar levels of
GPU-accelerated performance as a desktop.

### About Jetson TK1

[![Jetson TK1 dev
board](http://eLinux.org/images/thumb/2/27/Nvidia-tegra124-jetson-tk1-labelled.jpg/800px-Nvidia-tegra124-jetson-tk1-labelled.jpg)](http://eLinux.org/File:Nvidia-tegra124-jetson-tk1-labelled.jpg "Jetson TK1 dev board")

Jetson TK1 is NVIDIA's embedded Linux development platform featuring a
Tegra K1 SOC (CPU+GPU+ISP in a single chip), selling for \$192 USD.
Jetson TK1 comes pre-installed with
[Linux4Tegra](http://eLinux.org/Tegra/Downstream_SW/Linux4Tegra "Tegra/Downstream SW/Linux4Tegra")
OS (basically Ubuntu 14.04 with pre-configured drivers). There is also
some official support for running other distributions using the mainline
kernel, discussed further in the [Distributions](#Distributions) and
[Mainline](#Mainline) kernel sections below.

Besides the quad-core 2.3GHz ARM Cortex-A15 CPU and the revolutionary
Tegra K1 GPU, the Jetson TK1 board includes similar features as a
Raspberry Pi but also some PC-oriented features such as SATA, mini-PCIe

## Buying Guide

Where can I get one and for how much?

-   Visit the [NVIDIA store](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-tk1)
    then choose a distributor in USA, or click on "International Orders"
    to see other countries it is available from including UK, Germany,
    France, Italy, Japan, Russia, China, Singapore, and Australia.
-   Jetson TK1 costs \$192 in USA.
-   The package includes a power supply (with a detachable US mains
    cord), a USB micro-B cable for connecting it to a PC, and usually a
    [USB micro-B to female USB-A
    adapter](http://www.amazon.com/USB-Micro-Female-Male-Adaptor/dp/B0023FTRUO)
    allowing you to have 2 regular USB ports.
-   There are a large number of optional accessories you can add to
    Jetson such as [Cameras](http://eLinux.org/Jetson/Cameras "Jetson/Cameras"), SATA
    hard-disks and [mini-PCIe](http://eLinux.org/Jetson/mini-PCIe "Jetson/mini-PCIe")
    devices.



## Setting up a new board

To configure a new board, or factory reset an existing Jetson, visit the
official [Get Started On
Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/get-started-jetson) page,
particularly to read the Quick Start guides to "flash" your device (wipe
it clean and install Linux onto it). And if you will want to do software
development for your Jetson, such as to build CUDA code, you should
install the JetPack (Jetson Development Package) as mentioned in the
Quick Start Guides to install a graphical IDE with cross-compilation,
debugging & visual profiling tools.



## Basic setup steps to access the board and access internet

Whether you want to sew your embedded Tegra into a backpack or put it in
a robot or simply use it as an ultra powerful media center, the first
thing you should do with a new Jetson TK1 board is attach it to a HDMI
monitor & keyboard & mouse to make sure it works and get familiar with
it for a few minutes.

**Note: the micro-USB port on Jetson TK1 can be used as a second USB
port if you use the supplied
[adapter](http://www.amazon.com/eForCity-Adapter-compatible-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B00871Q5PI/).**

The device can be accessed in 2 possible ways, depending on whether you
want to plug a keyboard & mouse & monitor directly into the Jetson TK1
board or you want to plug an Ethernet cable between your device and a PC
or laptop or router and access it through a network:

### Direct access to a Jetson board using its own keyboard & mouse & monitor

The [Jetson TK1 Quick Start
Guide](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson/TK1/docs/Jetson_TK1_QSG_134sq_Jun14_rev7.pdf)
(included as a booklet with your Jetson TK1) shows how to use the Jetson
TK1 board as a mini standalone computer. Basically, you plug in a HDMI
monitor or TV, plug a keyboard into the USB3.0 port, plug a mouse into
the included micro-B to female USB adapter and plug that into the
micro-B USB2.0 port on the board. Then plug the 12V power supply in,
press the small POWER button, then watch it boot up into
[Linux4Tegra](http://eLinux.org/Tegra/Downstream_SW/Linux4Tegra "Tegra/Downstream SW/Linux4Tegra")
(Ubuntu 14.04 with some drivers pre-configured). When it asks for the
password for user "ubuntu", just type "ubuntu" to log in. If you have an
Ethernet router then simply plug an Ethernet cable from the board into
your router (or plug in a USB Wifi dongle) to have internet access, and
you are ready.

### [Remote access to a Jetson board through the Ethernet port](http://eLinux.org/Jetson/Remote_Access "Jetson/Remote Access")

To access the board remotely through a local network from a PC or
laptop, follow the [Remote
Access](http://eLinux.org/Jetson/Remote_Access "Jetson/Remote Access") instructions so
you can control the device from the keyboard & mouse & monitor on your
PC or laptop and share your desktop's Wifi or Ethernet internet access
to the attached device.

## An important step before connecting the Jetson to Internet

It is really important to tell "apt" not to overwrite the file
"libglx.so" if you upgrade the system. "libglx.so" is a specific file in
NVIDIA's graphics driver that might get replaced by an incorrect version
from Ubuntu that stops you from being able to boot into the graphical
environment! So please execute this command on your Jetson before you
connect it to Internet or perform an update:

    sudo apt-mark hold xserver-xorg-core

Now you can allow Ubuntu to update itself automatically or you can run
"sudo apt-get upgrade" without problems. You can get more information
about this issue on the [official development
forum](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/775070/embedded-systems/notice-on-apt-get-upgrade-libglx-so-corruption/).
Note: Is this only a problem for L4T Rel-19 only? It seems fixed in
Rel-21.

## Recommended first steps now that your board has internet access

Open a command-line terminal to perform some initial operations. If you
are using the Jetson TK1's graphical environment then click on the
top-left icon in Ubuntu Unity and type "terminal" to open a command
shell, or if you have remote access to the device through a network then
open an SSH command shell into your device from your desktop such as by
running "ssh ubuntu@tegra-ubuntu". Now you are ready for initial
configuration.

Add the Universe package repositories, since you will often need
packages from Universe for code development:

    sudo apt-add-repository universe
    sudo apt-get update

##### If you will use the shell command-line a lot

Install "bash-completion" (it allows you to hit the "Tab" key to
auto-complete your shell commands) and "command-not-found" (it shows
which package you probably need to install if you run an unavailable
command). These 2 tools are extremely useful when using the commandline,
but were not installed by default in Ubuntu 14.04. Simply run this:

    sudo apt-get install bash-completion command-not-found
    exit

Note: now you need to log back in for it to start using bash-completion
and command-not-found.

You probably should also change the shell prompt (by adjusting "PS1" in
the ".bashrc" file in your home directory) to be more useful, such as
getting the shell prompt to have a different color than regular
commands, and make it obvious if a command returned with an error. There
are thousands of custom .bashrc configurations on the web, including
[Shervin's](https://github.com/shervinemami/Stuff) that provides a
different colored shell prompt depending on whether a command was
succesful or returned an error.

##### If you will use the graphical environment (Unity) a lot

You might want to try some suggestions at
"[http://itsfoss.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-14-04/](http://itsfoss.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-14-04/)"
or similar, such as to turn off the desktop shopping suggestions that
are enabled by default in Ubuntu 14.04 (despite the spyware concerns
discussed by huge numbers of people) by running this:

    gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Lenses disabled-scopes "['more_suggestions-amazon.scope', \
        'more_suggestions-u1ms.scope', 'more_suggestions-populartracks.scope', 'music-musicstore.scope', \
        'more_suggestions-ebay.scope', 'more_suggestions-ubuntushop.scope', 'more_suggestions-skimlinks.scope']"

##### If you need more disk space on the eMMC

The eMMC on the Jetson has a capacity of 16GB, however some instructions
or boards default to only using 8GB of the drive ([or 12GB, see
discussion](http://elinux.org/Talk:Jetson_TK1#eMMC_8Gb.3F_860)). If you
require more disk space in your rootfs such as for installing toolkits
or compiling large projects, you can flash the Jetson (from a Linux
desktop) to have a larger filesystem (note that this will erase all data
on the Jetson TK1, and it takes roughly 1 hour to flash the whole
eMMC!):

    [user@host Linux_for_Tegra]$ sudo ./flash.sh -S 14580MiB jetson-tk1 mmcblk0p1
    ...
    sending file: system.img
    / 15032385536/15032385536 bytes sent
    system.img sent successfully
    ...
    Create, format and download  took 2791 Secs
    Time taken for flashing 2792 Secs

The maximum value of the `flash.sh -S` flag that works successfully is
14580MiB. Greater values (like 16GiB) are beyond the capacity of the
eMMC when the other system-required partitions are included.

##### More recommended Linux tips for a Jetson TK1

Some more tips (such as how to speed up SSH logins, login automatically,
share your keyboard & mouse, etc, are in a [forum
discussion](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/785551/embedded-systems/my-jetson-focused-linux-tips-and-tricks/).



## Shutting down Jetson TK1 safely

Just like any Linux computer, the recommended way to shut-down or turn
off Jetson TK1 is to click Shutdown in the GUI or run this in a
terminal, to ensure the filesystem will not be corrupt:

    sudo shutdown -h now
